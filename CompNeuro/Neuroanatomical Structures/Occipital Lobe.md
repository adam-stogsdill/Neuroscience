In the back of the brain is the Occipital Lobe. This area processes visual input from the retinas via the thalamus. The retinas project in an orderly, spatiotopic way onto the posterior pole of the occipital lobe, called the V1 (visual area one), so that activity in different areas of V1 is related to whatever is in the image around your current point of gaze. (V1 is another map)

The occipital lobe has many other visual maps, all almost entirely devoted to processing vision. Subareas beyond V1 specialize in visual tasks such as color detection, depth perception, and motion detection.

These visual maps send projections to other area in the parietal and temporal lobe for further processing.

Damage to V1 causes blindness in that part of the visual field that projects there.

ðŸ§  The fact that the visual system gets an entire lobe for processing emphasizes the importance of high visual acuity and processing among our senses.
