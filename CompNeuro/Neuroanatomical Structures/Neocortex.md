The Neocortex gets the prefix ‚Äúneo‚Äù because its a relatively recent invention of mammalian brains.

With the expansion of the neocortex, the rest of the original components of the brain grew smaller!

The largest part of the brain (the thing you see form the top and sides) is the neocortex. The neocortex is really a 1.5ft^2 sheet of cells wadded up a bit to fit inside the head. The neurons form a complex neural circuit that is repeated millions of times on the surface.

This repeated neural circuit is called a **minicolumn.**

A large neocortex distinguishes mammals from other animals. The human neocortex is so large that it completely covers the rest of the brain except for a bit of the cerebellum that sticks out from the back. The neocortex enables the most complex mental activity that we associate with being human.

üß† **The relationship between the neocortex and the rest of the brain is twofold:**

1. **The neocortex acts like a set of complex subroutines in a computer program that allow more complex, nuanced, and specialized computations for processing sensory input and responding to it.** The neocortex allowed a new level of advanced behavior - particularly social behavior - culminating in humans with tool making and, ultimately, language and high-level consciousness.
2. **Somewhat paradoxically, the frontal lobe of the neocortex acts as the controller of controllers.** This is mediated by the complex multilayered working memory function of the prefrontal cortical areas that allow us to pursue complex multistep plans.
