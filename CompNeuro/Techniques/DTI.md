DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) is a variant of magnetic resonance imaging, and is sometimes called diffusion MRI. It measures the movement (diffusion) of water in the brain. Because water moves most easily down the cytoplasm of long cylindrical neural axons, DTI effectively measures axon tracts. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It is an important clinical instrument because axon tracts may be destroyed by strokes or other brain disorders.</mark>
