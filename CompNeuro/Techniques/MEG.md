MEG (magnetoencephalography) is based on the physics of electrical and magnetic fields. Active neurons generate electric currents that flow within the neurons and in the surrounding extracellular space. The EEG detects currents after they have become diffused across extracellular space, including the skull between the electrodes and the brain, leading to poor spatial resolution.

A fundamental property of electric currents, however, is that they produce magnetic fields, which arenâ€™t shunted by the intervening volume electrical conductor. The magnetic fields are small though so the MEG must be put in a shielded recording room and exotic low strength magnetic field detectors called SQUIDs (Super-conducting quantum interference devices).

Current research and medical instruments use many of theses SQUIDs over the entire brain to image a large region of the brain simultaneously. MEG has temporal resolution nearly as fast as EEGs, and spatial resolution on the order of [[fMRI]].
