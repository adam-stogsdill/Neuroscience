On the physiological front, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in the early 20th century revealed that the brain was constantly producing electrical oscillations that could be recorded from the surface of the skull.

When different thought patterns occurred it led to different oscillations. The EEG has a few deficiencies, though, which make it less than ideal for careful brain study:

* The EEG averages activity over large areas so localizing the source of the recorded activity in the brain is hard. The averaging also tends to miss much of the complexity of the brain activity.
* The intrinsic ongoing activity in the brain tends to be larger than, - and tends to swamp - the smaller, transient signal elicited by particular stimuli, such as showing someone a picture, which makes the EEG a poor method to study the effect of stimuli on brain activity.

>This problem was solved to some extend by repeating the stimulus multiple times and recording each event so that, after hundreds of trials, the responses to the stimulus would be added together to increase their strength. Such recordings are generally called ERPs (Evoked Response Potentials). In the visual system, they are typically called VEPs (visual evoked potentials).

In the early to mid-20th century, micro electrodes began to be used in animal experiments to reveal how single neurons produced action potentials.

>On the motor side, muscle action potentials, alpha motor neuron spikes, and motor cortex firing were recorded with microelectrodes.

However, because microelectrode recording is invasive, it has had little or no applicability in humans.

After the middle of the 20th century new imaging techniques, explained in the following sections, began to be commonly used.
