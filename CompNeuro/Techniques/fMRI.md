The fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a derivative of MRI, which is used to image brain structure at high resolution. The MRI imaging technique uses a high magnetic field and radio frequency to detect transitions in the spin of protons (usually in water molecules) in the brain, and was formerly referred to as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

High contrast between gray matter and white matter, at millimeter resolution. In fMRI, blood flow or blood oxygenation/deoxygenation is detected by dynamically with a time resolution of several seconds. Blood flow changes and blood deoxygenation are metabolic measures believed to reflect real neural activity.

Typically a structural MRI scan is done first and then the fMRI functional scan is superimposed on the structural scan to locate areas of differential activity between task and rest. 

Because there are no radioactive isotopes, fMRI is considered safe and protocols can be repeated many times in a single session to improve signal to noise.
