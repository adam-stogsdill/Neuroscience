<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Sensory neurons</mark>: Neurons that tell the rest of the brain about the external and internal environment.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Motor (and other output) neurons</mark>: Motor neurons contract muscles and mediate behavior, and other output neurons stimulate glands and organs.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Projection neurons</mark>: Communication neurons transmit signals from one brain area to another.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Interneurons</mark>: The vast majority of neurons in vertebrates are interneurons involved in local computations. Computational interneurons extract and process information coming in from the sense, compare the information to what's in memory, and use the information to plan and execute behavior. Each of the several hundred distinguishable brain regions contains several dozen distinct types or classes of computational interneurons that mediate the function of the brain area.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Minicolumn</mark>: A minicolumn is the neural circuit that composes the cortical surface.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Dendrites</mark>: Parts of the neurons that allow the neuron to accept information from data.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Axons</mark>: Part of the neuron where the signal from the neuron is transmitted to other neurons/targets.
