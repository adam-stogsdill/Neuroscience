Just as advice may fall on willing or deaf ears, the effects of a presynaptically released neurotransmitter on the postsynaptic neuron actually is mostly up to the _neurotransmitter receptor_ on the postsynaptic cell. Although receptors are highly specific for a single neurotransmitter, each neurotransmitter has many different types of receptors. Some receptors act faster than others, some are longer or shorter lasting, and some have multiple binding sites that might include one for a particular fast neurotransmitter plus additional sites that bind and respond to one or more neuromodulators. Postsynaptic receptor channels that are activated by neurotransmitters released by a presynaptic neuron are generally referred to as _ligand-gated ion channels._

One important difference between receptors types depends on a crucial difference between their structures. The image below shows a typical neurotransmitter receptor sitting in the cell membrane.

Most neurotransmitter receptors have a binding site for the neurotransmitter on the outside of the membrane, which, when the neurotransmitter is bound, causes the receptor protein to refold in such a way that a pore opens in the receptor complex that allows a particular ion to go through the otherwise impervious cell membrane. These are thus called _neurotransmitter-gated_ (also _ligand-gated_) receptors. The receptor type with the ion pore in the same receptor structure as that binding site is called an _ionotropic_ receptor. Most fast excitatory and inhibitory receptors are of this type.

There is another type of receptor structure, common for neuromodulators. In this structure, the ion channel pore is not in the same place as the binding site for the neurotransmitter. Instead, the neurotransmitter binding on the outside of the membrane such that it releases some internal, intracellular neural modulator. These modulators function as internal messengers inside the cell that often involve biochemical cascades that amplify their actions.

Neurotransmitter binding to metabotropic receptors can cause multiple effects, from opening several nearby channel pores from the inside to changing the expression of DNA in the nucleus. These types of effects tend to be much slower but longer lasting compared to those mediated by ionotropic receptors. The receptor types without their own ion channels that have these indirect effects are called _metabotropic_ receptors.
