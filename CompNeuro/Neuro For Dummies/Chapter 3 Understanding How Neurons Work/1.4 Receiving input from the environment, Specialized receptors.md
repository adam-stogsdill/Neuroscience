Some neurons receive inputs not as as neurotransmitter squirts from other neurons, but as energy from the environment:

* In the eye, specialized neurons called _photoreceptors_ catch photons of light and convert those into neurotransmitter release.
* In the ear, cells called _auditory hair cells_ bend in response to sound pressure in the inner ear.
* IN the skin, _somatosensory receptors_ respond to pressure and pain.
* In the nose, olfactory neurons respond to odorants. Think of the odorants from the world outside the body as neurotransmitters themselves, with different olfactory receptors responding to different.
* On the tongue, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty molecules excite different receptors in the taste buds.

The nervous system also has outputs such as the motor system. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Motor neurons output their neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) onto the muscle cells that contract when receptors in the muscle cells receive it.</mark> The control of voluntary striated muscle generally occurs after the brain has done a lot of planning that you’re mostly not aware of about what you’re going to do and which muscles in which patterns are going to contract for you to do that.
