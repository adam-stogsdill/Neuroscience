What are the dendrites and axons for? Let’s start with the dendrites, or _dendritic tree_.

>[!tip] Tree Structures
>Think about what the branches of a normal tree are for: They’re the structures that make places for the leaves, whose purpose is to gather sunlight for energy and to build organic compounds that the tree needs. A neuron’s dendritic tree does the same thing in a way. It’s the structure that creates places for _synaptic receptors_ that gather information from other neurons. And as trees may have thousands of leaves, neurons have thousands of receptors.
