What are neurons, and how do they enable minds? 

[[Neuron|Neurons]] are specialized cells that process information.  Some neurons are receptors that convert sensory stimuli into messages processed by the brain, while other neurons stimulate muscles and glands. Most neurons are connected to other neurons and perform computations that allow an organism - you - to behave in complex ways, based on what the body senses internally and externally, now, in the experienced past, and in the expected future.

This chapter will explain how neurons function, how we know what we do about how the nervous system operates, and what new techniques are extending our knowledge of brain function.
