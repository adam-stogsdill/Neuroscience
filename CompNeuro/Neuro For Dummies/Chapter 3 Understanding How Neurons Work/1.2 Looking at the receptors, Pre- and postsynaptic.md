What are the receptors for, you ask? <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Neural synaptic receptors receive information via little squirts of neurotransmitters from other neurons.</mark> 💦

Each little squirt of neurotransmitter tells the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">postsynaptic receptor (the receptor on the receiving neuron’s dendritic tree)</mark> a message from the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">presynaptic cell (the one doing the squirting).</mark>

For a receiving neuron, it’s like listening to hundreds of brokers simultaneously on the floor of a stock exchange. Some of the brokers are squirting happy 😀 messages about something and makes the postsynaptic neuron happy, or _excited_, while others are sending low-key messages that makes the postsynaptic neuron less excited or _inhibited_. Millisecond by millisecond, the excitement level of the postsynaptic neuron is determined by which inputs, among the thousands it receives, are active and how active they are.

>[!abstract] Activity
>The meaning of the activity (or excitement level) of a neuron is a function of who is talking to it and whom it is talking to. If our particular stockbroker neuron, for example, were listening to the output of other neurons talking about things like electrical wiring, certain mines in Chile, and production of pennies, our stockbroker neuron might embody information about the price of copper.

(Personal Note: This above callout is pretty interesting. I wonder though if thinking that the function of the neuron changes due to the function of the output neurons is a fallacy or if this is actually true. I guess that neurons in machine learning are similar but I know that the functionality there is not 1-to-1.)

>[!tip] Learning
>These connections become meaningful as a result of _learning_. Learning occurs when experiences modify the strength and identity of the interconnections between neurons and thus create memory. Suppose, for example, that your neuron receives inputs from some neurons that indicate you’re seeing the color gray; other neurons that indicate it’s big; others that indicate that it has a trunk; and other that respond to the image of tusks. Your postsynaptic neuron is going to be an elephant detector. The postsynaptic targets of this neuron might get other neuronal messages that the ears are big and that lions and giraffes are also nearby, in which case its activity would mean “We’re in Africa, and this is an African elephant.”
