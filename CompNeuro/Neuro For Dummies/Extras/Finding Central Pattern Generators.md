Some of the earliest neurological experiments by scientists like Sir Charles Scott Sherrington demonstrated the existence of what are called central pattern generators in the spinal cords of four-legged animals like cats. The central pattern generator is a neural circuit totally within the spinal cord that can control alternation of left and right hind or forelimbs and proper phasing between forelimbs and hind limbs, although this circuit can be overridden or otherwise controlled by central mechanisms.

Forelimb/hind limb phasing is different for different gaits. In normal four-legged walking, for example, the two forelimbs are in antiphase with each other, as are the two hindlimbs, and the fore- and hindlimbs on each side are antiphased, so that as the left forelimb goes back, the left hindlimb goes forward. Other gaits, like the trot, gallop, or canter, have different phase relationships.

By severing the connections between the brain and spinal cord in experimental animals, Sherrington showed that these gaits could be organized by the spinal cord itself in the absence of any brain control, when the animals were placed on a treadmill. The brain is needed, of course, to decide whether to walk, trot, run, hop, or turn in normal behavior.
