The left hemispheres receives most inputs from and controls mostly the right side of the body. This hemisphere in humans is also specialized for language, rule-based reasoning, and analytic skills.

The right hemispheres deals with the left side of the body, and it is better at visual pattern recognition and more holistic kinds of perception.

In most tasks, the two hemispheres use a divide-and-conquer strategy, where the left hemisphere processes the details, and the right takes in the big picture. The two hemispheres are connected by the largest fiber tract in the brain, the ***************corpus callosum***************, which contains 200 million fibers.

>[!tip] ðŸ§  Remember!
>How do scientists know about the differences in the abilities of the left versus right hemispheres? One important sources of evidence has come from people with intractable epilepsy who have had their corpus callosum cut to stop the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other. Stimuli can be presented to only one hemisphere of these patients. When stimuli are presented to the right, they cant verbally report about them but they can use their left hand to point to a picture of what was presented.
