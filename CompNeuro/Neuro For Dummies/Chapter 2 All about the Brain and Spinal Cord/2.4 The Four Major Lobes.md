## The Frontal Lobe

The [[Frontal Lobe]] (the brain has one on each side, of course) of the neocortex is, as its name implies, in the front. The frontal lobe gyrus just anterior to the central fissure (central sulcus) is the primary motor cortex.

![[primary_motor_cortex.png | 800]]

Cells in the primary motor cortex (upper motor neurons) send their axons (outputs cables) down he spinal cord and connect directly to motor neurons that activate muscles (lower motor neurons).

>[!tip] Motor Map
>The ‚ÄúMotor Map‚Äù (called a homunculus) has some interesting properties. One is that the area of primary motor cortex devoted to driving muscles in the face and hands, for example, is proportionally much larger than the devoted to driving much larger muscles such as in the leg. This is because the muscles in areas like the face are more finely differentiated to allow very complex and subtle patterns of activation, whereas many large muscles mostly just vary in the amount of contraction of the entire muscle.

In humans, the prefrontal cortex takes up the majority of the frontal lobe. The **primary motor cortex** is the most posterior portion of the lobe, starting just anterior to the central sulcus. 

Moving from the primary motor cortex in the anterior direction, you have a series of regions that perform more and more abstract motor functions. The **supplementary and premotor cortex** areas are concerned with coordination and sequencing of movement of several muscles. Anterior to this are regions called the frontal eye fields, which are involved in visual attention.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The prefrontal cortex deals with the most abstract aspects of planning.</mark>

>[!fact] Frontal Lobe Polarization
>Think of the frontal lobe, which is concerned with executing behavior, as ‚Äúpolarized‚Äù from anterior to posterior. Farthest back, at the central sulcus, are neural wires going almost directly to muscles. In front of that are areas that organize and sequence movements. In front of that are abstract planning levels. At these abstract levels, for example, you select from a variety of different strategies that may involve completely different muscles, muscles sequences, or, the decision to not move at all.

An area of the prefrontal cortex called the **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex** (because it‚Äôs toward top/dorsal and outside/lateral) is crucial for what is called **************working memory**************, the contents of your thought at any given time. Working memory is essential for all high-level cognitive functions, including decision making and problem solving.

Below and more medial to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is an area called the **ventromedial prefrontal cortex**. This area is essential for social decision making (social intelligence) and risk assessment.

## The Parietal Lobe

Just posterior to the central sulcus is the parietal lobe. This lobe extends from the central sulcus back to a not very well structurally defined border with the occipital lobe. 

The **parietal lobe** contains neurons that receive sensory information from the skin and tongue, and processes sensory information from the ears and eyes that are received in other lobes.

The major sensory inputs from the skin:

- Touch
- Temperature
- Pain Receptors

These sensory inputs are relayed through the thalamus to the gyrus just posterior the central fissure, where a map of the skin exists. (Areas that are more sensitive are larger than areas that are less sensitive)


üí° The skin homunculus map closely resembles the primary motor cortex map. In order to execute a complex motor task like tying a knot, you need high touch sensitivity to guide the finally differentiated motor control.

## The Occipital Lobe

In the back of the brain is the Occipital Lobe. This area processes visual input from the retinas via the thalamus. The retinas project in an orderly, spatiotopic way onto the posterior pole of the occipital lobe, called the V1 (visual area one), so that activity in different areas of V1 is related to whatever is in the image around your current point of gaze. (V1 is another map)

The occipital lobe has many other visual maps, all almost entirely devoted to processing vision. Subareas beyond V1 specialize in visual tasks such as color detection, depth perception, and motion detection.

These visual maps send projections to other area in the parietal and temporal lobe for further processing.

Damage to V1 causes blindness in that part of the visual field that projects there.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The fact that the visual system gets an entire lobe for processing emphasizes the importance of high visual acuity and processing among our senses.</mark>

## The Temporal Lobe

The **temporal lobe** combines both auditory and visual information.

The superior (upper) and medial (central) aspects of the temporal lobe receives auditory input from the part of the thalamus that relays information from the ears.

The inferior (lower) part of the temporal lobe does visual processing for object and pattern recognition.

The medial and anterior parts of the temporal lobe are involved in high-order visual recognition (being able to recognize faces) as well as recognition depending on memory.

The temporal lobe is a region of the brain that is located just below the temples on either side of the head. This lobe is involved in several important functions, including:

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Auditory processing</mark>: The temporal lobe is responsible for processing and interpreting sounds, including speech and music.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Memory</mark>: The temporal lobe is involved in both short-term and long-term memory, and damage to this region can impair memory function.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Emotion and behavior</mark>: The temporal lobe plays a role in the processing of emotions, and is also involved in the regulation of some behaviors.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Spatial processing</mark>: The temporal lobe is involved in the perception of spatial relationships, such as the location of objects in space.

Overall, the temporal lobe is an important part of the brain that plays a key role in many of the cognitive processes that are essential for human functioning.
