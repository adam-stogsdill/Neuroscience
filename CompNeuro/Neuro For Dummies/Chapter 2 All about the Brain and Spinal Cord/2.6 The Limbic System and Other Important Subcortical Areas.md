Below the neocortex are several important subcortical brain areas. One of the most important is a network of distinct, phylogenetically old nuclei called the limbic system. Several important structures are within the limbic system.

The limbic system evolved to incorporate memory into overall behavior control via the **hippocampus** and **amygdala**. These memory structures interact not only with the neocortex, but also with an other type of cortex called the cingulate cortex.

The **cingulate cortex** is sometimes called the **mesocortex**, a type of cortex that evolved as a high-level controller, before the neocortex, to control behavior.

Brain areas within the limbic system add memory of past experiences and circumstances to modify pure instinct. The top integrating area for all this limbic computation may once have been the cingulate cortex.

Mammals add additional layers to the limbic system. These extra layers add more computational capability to the system.

>[!tip] Mammals vs Lizard
>For example, many predatory mammals hunt in packs or family groups that take turns driving prey towards rested members of the pack, using very complex and flexible cooperative strategies. You never see lizards do this. Although lizards have limbic systems and memory areas such as the hippocampus, they lack a large neocortex to do really complex memory-contigent calculations.

## The Hippocampus

The limbic system was originally thought to be involved in generating and processing emotions. Now we know the hippocampus has a crucial function in the creation of memory.

The hippocampus received inputs from virtually the entire neocortex. Through specialized <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">adjustable synaptic receptors</mark> called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">NMDA receptors</mark>, it can associate together virtually any constellation of properties that define an object and its context. The kinds of memories the hippocampus are involved in creating are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">explicit, knowledge-based memories, such as associating the west end of a water hole with danger from a predator</mark>. Learning associated with motor skill improvement, such as getting faster at running a particular obstacle course, occurs in the cerebellum and motor cortex.

## The Amygdala

Just in front of the hippocampus is another memory structure that is primarily involved with emotional processing, the amygdala.

It interacts with the orbitofrontal/ventromedial prefrontal cortex to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">generate and process the major emotions of anger, happiness, disgust, surprise, sadness, and, particularly, fear.</mark>

## Orbitofrontal Cortex

The amygdala and other structures of the limbic system interact with the part of the prefrontal cortex called the orbitofrontal cortex.

>[!note] Orbitofrontal in Action
>Suppose that, on some particular Friday evening while driving home, you’re almost hit by another car at a particular intersection. It is very likely that, for a long time after that, when approaching that intersection, particularly on Fridays, you’ll get a little twinge of fear or uneasiness. Your orbitofrontal cortex has stored the circumstances, and the amygdala has stored the fear.

## The Anterior Cingulate Cortex

The amygdala and other structures of the limbic system also interact with an area of the mesocortex called the _anterior cingulate cortex_, which is the most anterior part of the cingulate cortex.

This area of the brain seems to monitor the progress toward whatever goal you’re pursuing and generates an “uh-oh” signal when things aren’t working out to indicate a change in strategy may be in order.

## The Basal Ganglia

Another group of subcortical brain structures that are crucial in planning, organizing, and executing movement (alongside the frontal lobes) are the _**basal ganglia**_. The basal ganglia consists of five major nuclei:

1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The Cuadate</mark>: Inputs to the basal ganglia from the neocortex primarily come into the caudate and another nucleus called the putamen. The system of both the caudate and putamen is now usually called the striatum. It is a ring of cells that surrounds the basal ganglia complex except on the ventral side. Caudate output → globus palladus.
2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The Putamen</mark>: A large nucleus within the basal ganglia complex with similar input-output connections as the caudate.
3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The Globus Palladus</mark>: The primary output nucleus of the basal ganglia via its inhibitory connections to the [thalamus](https://www.notion.so/Thalamus-53519e3a34e24c419810597ad4f87e29).
4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The Substantia Nigra</mark>: Sends “enabling” connections to signals passing through the striatum. Known for its involvement in Parkinson’s disease, which is caused by the death of dopaminergic neurons in this nucleus. Without these neurons, initiating voluntary. movement becomes difficult.
5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The Subthalamic Nucleus</mark>: The subthalamic nucleus also modulates the **globus palladus** output. This nucleus is frequently the target of deep brain stimulation surgical implants to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

>[!note] A note to the reader!
>The basal ganglia experts admit that the internal functional architecture of the system is poorly understood at present.
