The brain is a part of your nervous system, which is a network of subsystems and interrelated parts. The brain and spinal cord together (with the retina in the eye) constitute the Central Nervous System. The spinal cord connects to muscles, organs and receptors via the peripheral nervous system,  which includes the autonomic nervous system that regulates involuntary movements (think heart rate, digestive processes, and internal temperature regulation, to name just a few). The nervous system consists of neurons, which do the work of processing and communicating signals, and glial cells that form the structure in which the neurons reside and provide important support for keeping the neurons functional and happy.

This chapter presents the gross anatomy of the brain and spinal cord (no, not gross as in disgusting, but gross as in big). The chapter outlines the technology used to understand how the brain works and examines the controversial hypothesis that male and female brains process information differently.
