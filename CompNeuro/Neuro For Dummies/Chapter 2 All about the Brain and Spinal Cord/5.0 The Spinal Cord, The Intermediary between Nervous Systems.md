The spinal cord is a key part of the central nervous system. Specifically, within the spinal cord are the connections between the CNS (such as motor neurons from primary motor cortex) and the peripheral nervous system, PNS, (skin, muscle, and tendon receptors going to the spinal cord, and **alpha** motor neurons relaying motor commands from the spinal cord to the actual muscles).

The spinal cord also has integration and coordination functions, although it is close to the lowest level of the hierarchy of controllers. It mediates feedback between sensory and motor pathways for each limb and coordinates limb movements for locomotion.

 üß† Each level of the spinal cord contains a local processing module for the area of the body controlled from that segment, plus connections to other spinal cord segments and to and from the brain (through the medulla all the way to neocortex).

-   The top of the spinal cord deals with muscles and sensory information from the neck
-   The bottom spinal cord segments deal with the toes

The spinal cord segments are designated as 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 3 coccygeal.

These are numbered from the top down, so the highest cervical spinal segment is C1, while the lowest sacral segment is S5.
