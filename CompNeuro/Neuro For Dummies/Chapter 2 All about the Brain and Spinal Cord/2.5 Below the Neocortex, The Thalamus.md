So whatâ€™s underneath the neocortex? The Thalamus. The cortex interacts with the rest of the brain primarily via a structure called the **thalamus**, which you can see along with other structures in the image above.

The thalamus and another structure called the **hypothalamus**(which controls homeostatic body functions such as temp and circadian rhythms) constitute the **diencephalon**. The diencephalon is the name give to the thalamus and hypothalamus because of their position below the neocortex and because of their interrelation during embryonic development.

>[!tip] Origin and Function
>The root of the word thalamus comes from a Greek word (tholos) related to the entrance room to a building, so you can think of the thalamus as the gateway to the cortex. Virtually all signals from the sense are relayed through the thalamus, as are the signals from other subcortical areas. Many areas of the neocortex also communicate with each other through the thalamus.

The thalamus controls what information goes between different parts of the neocortex and the rest of the brain. When your neocortex is damaged, you lose particular skills. If your thalamus is damaged sufficiently, you lose consciousness.
