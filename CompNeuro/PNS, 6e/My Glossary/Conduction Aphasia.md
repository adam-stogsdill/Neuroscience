A form of aphasia where the [[Arcuate Fasciculus]] is damaged and some way. It is characterized by frequent, sound-based speech errors (_phonemic paraphasias_), repetition difficulties, and severe limitation in verbal working memory.

Patients with conduction aphasia understand words that they hear and read, and have no motor difficulties when they speak. Yet they cannot speak coherently; they omit parts of words or substitute incorrect sounds and experience great difficulties in verbatim repetition of a multisyllabic word, phrase, or sentence that they hear or read or recall from memory. Although painfully aware of their own errors, their successive attempts at self-correction are often unsuccessful.
