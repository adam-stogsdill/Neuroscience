Mutations can result from damage to the purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA, mistakes during the DNA replication process, and recombinations that occur during meiosis. Changes in a single DNA base (also called a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">point mutation</mark>) within a coding region fall into five general categories, which we will detail further here.

1) <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">A silent mutation</mark> → There is a change in a base but it does not result in an obvious change in the encoded protein.
2) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A missense mutation</mark> → a point mutation that results in one amino acid in a protein being substituted for another; increasingly these are being categorized using both informatics and empirical evidence into at least two subclasses; mutations that are damaging to protein function and those that may be functionally neutral.
3) <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">A nonsense mutation</mark> → where a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">codon within the coding region</mark> specifying a specific amino acid is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">replaced by a stop codon</mark>, resulting in a truncated protein product.
4) <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A canonical splice site mutation</mark> → changes a nucleotide that specifies the exon/intron boundary.
5) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A frameshift mutation</mark> → where small insertions or deletions of nucleotides changes the reading frame, leading to the production of a truncated or abnormal protein.
