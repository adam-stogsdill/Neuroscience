Genes are transcribed as continuous sequences, but only some segments of the resulting messenger RNA molecules contain information that encodes a protein product. These segments are called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">exons</mark>. The regions between exons are known as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">introns</mark> and are spliced from the RNA before the product is made.
