Initiated at a specialized trigger region near the origin of the axon called the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">initial segment</mark>. From there the action potential s propagate down the axon without failure or distortion at speeds of 1 to 100 m/s.

### The Amplitude
The amplitude of an action potential traveling down the axon remains constant at **100 mV** because the action potential is an <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">all-or-none impulse that is regenerated at regular intervals along the axon.</mark>

### Functionality
Action potentials are the signals by which the brain <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">receives</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">analyzes</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conveys information</mark>. Though they are initiated by a variety of events (light to mechanical contact, from odorants to pressure waves), <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the physiological signals</mark> that convey information about things are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all identical</mark>.

### Evaluation (How it conveys information)
The type of information conveyed by an action potential is determined not by the form of the signal but by the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">pathway the signal travels in the brain</mark>. The brain thus analyzes and interprets patterns of incoming electrical signals carried over specific pathways, and in turn creates our sensations of sight, touch, taste, small, and sound.
