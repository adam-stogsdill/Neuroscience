Near the end of the axon, it divides into fine branches that contact other neurons at specialized zones of communication known as <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">synapses</mark>.

### Presynaptic Cell and Post Synaptic Cell
* The cell **transmitting** the signal is called the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">presynaptic cell</mark>
* The cell **receiving** the signal is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">postsynaptic cell</mark>
* The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">presynaptic cell transmits signals from specialized regions of its axon's branches</mark>, called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">presynaptic terminals</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">nerve terminals</mark>.
* The presynaptic cell and postsynaptic cell are separate by a narrow space, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">synaptic cleft</mark>.
