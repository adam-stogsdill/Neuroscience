1) The structural components of individual nerve cells
2) The mechanisms by which neurons produce signals within themselves and between each other
3) The patterns of connection between nerve cells and between nerve cells and their targets (muscle and gland effectors)
4) The relationship of different Patterns of Interconnection to different types of behavior
5) How neurons and their connections are modified by experience
