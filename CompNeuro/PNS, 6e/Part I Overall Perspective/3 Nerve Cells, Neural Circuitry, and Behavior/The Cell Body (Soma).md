The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">cell body</mark> or _soma_ is the metabolic center of the cell which contains:
* The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nucleus</mark>, which contains the genes of the cell, and the endoplasmic reticulum, and extension of the nucleus where the cell's proteins are synthesized.

Usually gives rise to two kinds of processes:
1) Several short <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">dendrites</mark>, branching out in a tree-like fashion - the main apparatus for **receiving incoming signals** from other nerve cells.
2) One long, tubular <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">axon</mark>, extending some distance from the cell body before branching out, **allowing it to carry signals to many target neurons**. (0.1mm â†’ 1m) These electrical signals are called <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">action potentials</mark>.
