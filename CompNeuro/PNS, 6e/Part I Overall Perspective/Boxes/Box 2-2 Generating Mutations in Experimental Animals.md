### Random Mutagenesis in Flies

Genetic analysis of behavior in the fruit fly (_Drosophila_) is carried out on flies in which individual genes have been mutated. They can induce mutations using <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">chemical mutagenesis</mark> or by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">insertional mutagenesis</mark> (we can affect **any** gene in the genome).

Similar random mutagenesis strategies are used to create mutations in nematode worm _Caenorhabditis elegans_, zebra fish, and mice.

**Chemical mutagenesis** (with ethyl methanesulonate (EMS)), typically creates <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">random point mutations</mark> in genes.

**Insertional mutagenesis**, occurs when mobile DNA sequences called _transposable elements_ <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">randomly insert themselves into other genes</mark>.

The most widely used transposable elements in _Drosophila_ are the P elements. P elements may be modified to carry genetic markers for eye color, which makes them easy to track genetic crosses, and they may also be modified to alter expression  of the gene into which they are also inserted.
