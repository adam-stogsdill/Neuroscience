The first areas of the cerebral cortex identified as important for cognition were areas concerned with language.
These discoveries came from studies of **[[Aphasia|aphasia]]**, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a language disorder that most often occurs when certain areas of brain tissue are destroyed by a stroke, the occlusion or rupture of a blood vessel supplying a portion of the cerebral hemisphere</mark>. 

Many of the important discoveries in the study of aphasia occurred in rapid succession during the latter half of the 19th century. Leading to one of the most exciting chapters in neuroscientific study of human behavior.

Pierre Paul Broca, a French neurologist, was the first to identify specific areas of the brain concerned with language. Broca correlated clinical evidence of aphasia with brain lesions discovered post mortem. In 1861 he wrote, "I had thought that if there were ever a phrenological science, it would be the phrenology of **convolutions** (in the cortex), and not the phrenology of **bumps** (on the head)." Based on this insight Broca founded neuropsychology, an empirical science of mental processes that he distinguished from the phrenology of Gall.

In 1861 Broca described a patient, Leborgne, who as a result of a stroke could not speak but could also understand language perfectly well. There aren't anything that would hinder his ability from talking and was able to utter isolated words, whistle, and sing a melody without difficulty. He just had difficulty speaking grammatically, couldn't create complete sentences, and couldn't express his ideas in writing.

Postmortem examination of the patient's brain showed a lesion in a posterior inferior region of the left frontal lobe, now called [[Broca's Area]]. Broca then studied 8 different patients with similar cases and in those cases, the lesion was located in the left hemisphere. This discovery led him to announce in 1864, "Nous parlons avec l'hemisphere gauche!" (We speak with the left hemisphere!).

This work would encourage further work! In 1870 Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzip found that they <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">could move a dog's paw</mark> by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">electrically stimulating discrete regions of the precentral gyrus.</mark> They also found that the left hemisphere controlled the right side of the body (and vice versa).

In 1876, Karl Wernicke published a paper called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">"The Symptom-Complex of Aphasia: A Psychological Study on an Anatomical Basis."</mark> In it he describes another type of **aphasia**, a failure of comprehension rather than speech. (A _receptive_ malfunction as opposed to a _expressive_ one) 

While Broca's patients could understand language and be unable to generate language, Karl's patients did the opposite and could generate language but would not be able to understand it. The lesion that would cause this occurred in the posterior part of the cerebral cortex where the temporal lobe meets the parietal lobe. (i.e. Wernicke's area)
