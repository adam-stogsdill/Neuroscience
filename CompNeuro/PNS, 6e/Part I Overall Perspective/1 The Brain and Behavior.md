## Introduction
The last frontier of the biological sciences is to understand the basis of consciousness and the brain processes by which we:
* feel 
* act
* learn
* remember

During the past few decades, a remarkable unification within the biological sciences has set the stage for addressing this great challenge.

The ability to sequence genes and infer the amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode has revealed unanticipated similarities between proteins in the nervous system and those encountered elsewhere in the body. As a result, it has become possible to establish a general plan for the function of cells, a plan that provides a common conceptual framework for all of cell biology, including cellular neural science.

The current challenge in the unification within biology is the unification of:
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">psychology</mark> → the science of the mind
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">neural science</mark> → the science of the brain.
This unification can only exist if we find that all behavior is the result of brain function (which is what we are largely running on in our assumptions).

Brain processes underlie all function, from the simple <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">motor behaviors</mark> (walking and eating) to more difficult and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complex cognitive acts</mark> (thinking, speaking, and creating works of art).

Neural science must continually confront certain fundamental questions.
* What is the appropriate level of biological description to understand a thought process, the movement of a limb, or the desire to make the movement?
* Why is a movement smooth or jerky or made unintentionally in certain neurological disease states?

Answers to these questions might emerge from looking at the pattern of DNA expression in nerve cells and how this patter regulates the electrical properties of neurons. However, we will also require knowledge of neural circuits comprising many neurons in specific brain areas and how the activity of specific circuits in many brain areas is coordinated.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Is there a level of biological description that is most apt? It depends</mark>
If you want to **understand** and **treat** certain _genetic epilepsy disorders_, then DNA sequencing and measurements of electrical properties of individual neurons might be sufficient to produce an effective therapy.
If you are interested in **learning**, **perception** and **exploration**, then an analysis of _systems of circuits and brain regions_ is likely required.

The effort of integrating these specialized levels into a single "science" forces us to ask a _few questions_.
* If mental processes can be localized to discrete brain regions, what is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">relationship between the functions of those regions and the anatomy and physiology of those regions</mark>?
* Is one kind of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">neural circuit required to process visual information, another type to parse speech, and yet another to sequence movements</mark>?
* Do <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">circuits with different functions</mark> share <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">common organizational principles</mark>?
* Are the requisite <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">neural computations</mark> best understood as operations on information represented by <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">single neurons</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">populations of neurons</mark>?
* Is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">information represented in the electrical activity of individual nerve cells</mark>, or is it <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">distributed over ensembles such that any one cell is no more information than a random bit of computer memory</mark>?

To understand these points we shall examine how modern neural science describes **language**, a distinctive cognitive behavior in humans. To do this, we will focus on operations in the **cerebral cortex**. We shall see how the cortex is organized into distinct regions, each with large groups of neurons, and how the neural apparatus of a highly complex behavior can be analyzed in terms of the activity of specific sets of interconnected neurons within specific regions.
