## Introduction
The last frontier of the biological sciences is to understand the basis of consciousness and the brain processes by which we:
* feel 
* act
* learn
* remember

During the past few decades, a remarkable unification within the biological sciences has set the stage for addressing this great challenge.

The ability to sequence genes and infer the amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode has revealed unanticipated similarities between proteins in the nervous system and those encountered elsewhere in the body. As a result, it has become possible to establish a general plan for the function of cells, a plan that provides a common conceptual framework for all of cell biology, including cellular neural science.

The current challenge in the unification within biology is the unification of:
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">psychology</mark> → the science of the mind
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">neural science</mark> → the science of the brain.
This unification can only exist if we find that all behavior is the result of brain function (which is what we are largely running on in our assumptions).

Brain processes underlie all function, from the simple <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">motor behaviors</mark> (walking and eating) to more difficult and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complex cognitive acts</mark> (thinking, speaking, and creating works of art).

Neural science must continually confront certain fundamental questions.
* What is the appropriate level of biological description to understand a thought process, the movement of a limb, or the desire to make the movement?
* Why is a movement smooth or jerky or made unintentionally in certain neurological disease states?

Answers to these questions might emerge from looking at the pattern of DNA expression in nerve cells and how this patter regulates the electrical properties of neurons. However, we will also require knowledge of neural circuits comprising many neurons in specific brain areas and how the activity of specific circuits in many brain areas is coordinated.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Is there a level of biological description that is most apt? It depends</mark>
If you want to **understand** and **treat** certain _genetic epilepsy disorders_, then DNA sequencing and measurements of electrical properties of individual neurons might be sufficient to produce an effective therapy.
If you are interested in **learning**, **perception** and **exploration**, then an analysis of _systems of circuits and brain regions_ is likely required.

The effort of integrating these specialized levels into a single "science" forces us to ask a _few questions_.
* If mental processes can be localized to discrete brain regions, what is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">relationship between the functions of those regions and the anatomy and physiology of those regions</mark>?
* Is one kind of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">neural circuit required to process visual information, another type to parse speech, and yet another to sequence movements</mark>?
* Do <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">circuits with different functions</mark> share <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">common organizational principles</mark>?
* Are the requisite <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">neural computations</mark> best understood as operations on information represented by <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">single neurons</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">populations of neurons</mark>?
* Is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">information represented in the electrical activity of individual nerve cells</mark>, or is it <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">distributed over ensembles such that any one cell is no more information than a random bit of computer memory</mark>?

To understand these points we shall examine how modern neural science describes **language**, a distinctive cognitive behavior in humans. To do this, we will focus on operations in the **cerebral cortex**. We shall see how the cortex is organized into distinct regions, each with large groups of neurons, and how the neural apparatus of a highly complex behavior can be analyzed in terms of the activity of specific sets of interconnected neurons within specific regions.

## Two Opposing Views Have Been Advanced on the Relationship Between Brain and Behavior
Our views about nerve cells, the brain, and behavior emerged during the 20th century from a synthesis of five experimental traditions:
* anatomy
* embryology
* physiology
* pharmacology
* psychology

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Golgi</mark> developed a method of staining neurons with silver salts that revealed their entire cell structure under the microscope. Golgi conclude that nerve cells are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not independent cells isolated from one another</mark> but instead <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">act together in one continuous web of tissue</mark> or **[[Syncytium]]**.

Using Golgi's technique, Ramon y Cajal observed that each neuron typically has a cell body and two types of processes:
1) branching dendrites at one end
2) a long, cable-like axon at the other

Cajal concluded that nervous tissue is not a [[Syncytium|syncytium]]but a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">network of discrete cells</mark>. In the course of this work, Ramon y Cajal developed some of the key concepts and much of the early evidence for the **_[[|neuron doctrine]]_** - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the principle that individual neurons are the elementary building blocks and signaling elements of the nervous system.</mark>


### Embryology
In the 1920s the American embryologist Ross Harrison <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">showed that the dendrites and axons grow from the cell body and do so even when each neuron is isolated from others in tissue culture</mark>. Harrison also confirmed Ramon y Cajal suggestion that the tip of the axon gives rise to an expansion, the _growth cone_, which <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">leads the developing axon to its target, either to other nerve cells or muscles</mark>. 

Both of these discoveries lent strong support to the [[CompNeuro/PNS, 6e/Glossary/Neuron Doctrine|neuron doctrine]]. The final definite evidence for the neuron doctrine came in the mid 1950s with the introduction of electron microscopy. A landmark study by Sanford Palay unambiguously demonstrated the existence of [[Synapse|synapses]], specialized regions of nerve cells that permit chemical or electrical signaling between them.

### Physiology
Physiological investigation of the nervous system began in the late 1700s when Luigi Galvani discovered that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">muscle and nerve cells produce electricity</mark>. Modern electrophysiology grew out of work in the 19th century because of the ability to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">measure the speed of conduction of electrical activity along the axon of the nerve cell and further showed that the electrical activity of one nerve cell affects the activity of an adjacent cell in predictable ways</mark>.

### Pharmacology
Pharm. made its first impact o our understanding of the nervous system and behavior at the end of the 19th century. Researchers in England demonstrated that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">drugs do not act randomly on a cell</mark>, but rather <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bind to discrete receptors typically located in the cell membrane</mark>. This insight led to the discovery that nerve cells can communicate with each other by chemical means.

### Psychology
Psychological thinking about behavior dates back to the beginnings of Western science when the ancient Greek philosophers speculated about the causes of behavior and the relation of the mind to the brain. In the 17th century Rene Descartes distinguished body and mind. In this _dualistic_ view: 
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the brain</mark> - mediates perception, motor acts, memory, appetites, and passions - everything that can be found in the lower animals
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the mind</mark> - the higher mental functions, the conscious experience characteristic of human behavior is represented in the soul

### Biological & Psychological Unification
Attempts to unify biology and psychology began as early as 1800. Franz Joseph Gall, proposed that the brain is the organ of the mind and that all mental functions are embodied in the brain. (He thus rejected the mind and body.)
![[Gall_brain.png|500]]
**An early map of functional localization according to Gall.**

The dominant view today is that many of the higher functions of mind are most likely highly distributed. Gall's experimental approach to localization was extremely naive. Rather than locate functions empirically, by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">looking into the brain and correlating defects in mental attributes with lesions in specific regions following tumor or stroke</mark>, Gall <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">spurned all evidence derived from studies of brain lesions, whether discovered through clinical examination or produced surgically in experimental animals</mark>.

Influenced by physiognomy, the popular science based on facial features reveal character. Gall believed that the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bumps and ridges</mark> on the skulls of people well endowed with specific cognitive faculties identified the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">centers for those faculties in the brain</mark>. He assumed that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">size of an area of brain</mark> was related to the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">relative importance of the mental faculty represented in that area</mark>. (Exercising of the brain in certain aspects will grow those aspects and cause the skull to protrude).

In the late 1820s, Gall's ideas were subjected to experimental analysis. Concluded that specific brain regions are **NOT** responsible for specific behaviors, _but that all brain regions, especially the cerebral hemispheres of the forebrain, participate in every mental operation._ Injury to any one area of the cerebral hemisphere should therefore affect all higher functions equally.

The rapid acceptance of the _holistic_ view of the brain, was based only partly on the above work. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It also represented a cultural reaction against the materialistic view that the human mind is a biological organ</mark>. (Remove the notion of the soul)

The holistic view was seriously challenged in the mid-19th century. In his studies of **focal epilepsy**, a disease characterized by convulsions that begin in a particular part of the body, it was shown that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">different motor and sensory functions could be traced to specific parts of the cerebral cortex</mark>. 

Extended this to the view of _cellular connectionism_, where individual neurons are the signaling units of the brain and connect to one another in a precise fashion. Future work revealed that different behaviors are produced by different interconnected brain regions.

The first **important** evidence for localization emerged from studies of how the brain produces language. Before we consider the relevant clinical and anatomical studies, we shall first review the overall structure of the brain, including its major anatomical regions. This requires that we define some essential navigational terms to navigate the 3 dimensional nature of the brain and spinal cord.

## The Brain has Distinct Functional Regions
The CNS is a bilateral and largely symmetrical structure with two main parts, the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">spinal cord and brain</mark>. The brain comprises six major structures:
1) The medulla oblongata
2) pons
3) cerebellum
4) midbrain
5) diencephalon
6) cerebrum

### Box 1-2 Anatomical Organization of the CNS

![[divisions of the CNS.png]]

**The Central Nervous System has Seven Main Parts**

The **spinal cord**, the most caudal part of the CNS, receives and processes sensory information from the skin, joints, and muscles of the limbs and trunk and controls movement of the limbs and the trunk. It is subdivided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions.
The spinal cord continues rostrally as the **brain stem**, which consists of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain</mark>. The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">brain stem receives sensory information</mark> from the skin and muscles of the head and provides the motor control for the head's musculature. It also conveys information from the spinal cord to the brain and from the brain to the spinal cord, and regulates levels of arousal and awareness through the reticular formation.

The brain stem contains several collections of cell bodies, the cranial nerve nuclei. Some of these nuclei receive information from the skin and muscles of the head; other control motor output to muscles of the face, neck, and eyes. Still others are specialized to process information from three of the special sense: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">hearing, balance, and taste</mark>.

The **[[Medulla Oblongata|medulla oblongata]]**, directly rostral to the spinal cord, includes several centers <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">responsible for vital autonomic functions, such as digestion, breathing, and the control of heart rate</mark>.

The **[[Pons|pons]]**, rostral to the medulla, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">conveys information about movement from the cerebral hemispheres to the cerebellum</mark>.

The **[[Cerebellum|cerebellum]]**, behind the pons, modulates the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">force and range of movement and is involved in the learning of motor skills</mark>. It is functionally connected to the three main organs of the brain stem: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain</mark>.

The **[[Midbrain|midbrain]]**, rostral to the pons, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">controls many sensory and motor functions</mark>, including eye movement and the coordination of visual and auditory reflexes.
