Our views about nerve cells, the brain, and behavior emerged during the 20th century from a synthesis of five experimental traditions:
* anatomy
* embryology
* physiology
* pharmacology
* psychology

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Golgi</mark> developed a method of staining neurons with silver salts that revealed their entire cell structure under the microscope. Golgi conclude that nerve cells are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not independent cells isolated from one another</mark> but instead <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">act together in one continuous web of tissue</mark> or **[[Syncytium]]**.

Using Golgi's technique, Ramon y Cajal observed that each neuron typically has a cell body and two types of processes:
1) branching dendrites at one end
2) a long, cable-like axon at the other

Cajal concluded that nervous tissue is not a [[Syncytium|syncytium]]but a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">network of discrete cells</mark>. In the course of this work, Ramon y Cajal developed some of the key concepts and much of the early evidence for the **_[[|neuron doctrine]]_** - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the principle that individual neurons are the elementary building blocks and signaling elements of the nervous system.</mark> ^92db20


### Embryology
In the 1920s the American embryologist Ross Harrison <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">showed that the dendrites and axons grow from the cell body and do so even when each neuron is isolated from others in tissue culture</mark>. Harrison also confirmed Ramon y Cajal suggestion that the tip of the axon gives rise to an expansion, the _growth cone_, which <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">leads the developing axon to its target, either to other nerve cells or muscles</mark>. 

Both of these discoveries lent strong support to the [[CompNeuro/PNS, 6e/My Glossary/Neuron Doctrine|neuron doctrine]]. The final definite evidence for the neuron doctrine came in the mid 1950s with the introduction of electron microscopy. A landmark study by Sanford Palay unambiguously demonstrated the existence of [[Synapse|synapses]], specialized regions of nerve cells that permit chemical or electrical signaling between them.

### Physiology
Physiological investigation of the nervous system began in the late 1700s when Luigi Galvani discovered that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">muscle and nerve cells produce electricity</mark>. Modern electrophysiology grew out of work in the 19th century because of the ability to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">measure the speed of conduction of electrical activity along the axon of the nerve cell and further showed that the electrical activity of one nerve cell affects the activity of an adjacent cell in predictable ways</mark>.

### Pharmacology
Pharm. made its first impact o our understanding of the nervous system and behavior at the end of the 19th century. Researchers in England demonstrated that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">drugs do not act randomly on a cell</mark>, but rather <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bind to discrete receptors typically located in the cell membrane</mark>. This insight led to the discovery that nerve cells can communicate with each other by chemical means.

### Psychology
Psychological thinking about behavior dates back to the beginnings of Western science when the ancient Greek philosophers speculated about the causes of behavior and the relation of the mind to the brain. In the 17th century Rene Descartes distinguished body and mind. In this _dualistic_ view: 
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the brain</mark> - mediates perception, motor acts, memory, appetites, and passions - everything that can be found in the lower animals
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the mind</mark> - the higher mental functions, the conscious experience characteristic of human behavior is represented in the soul

### Biological & Psychological Unification
Attempts to unify biology and psychology began as early as 1800. Franz Joseph Gall, proposed that the brain is the organ of the mind and that all mental functions are embodied in the brain. (He thus rejected the mind and body.)

**An early map of functional localization according to Gall.**

The dominant view today is that many of the higher functions of mind are most likely highly distributed. Gall's experimental approach to localization was extremely naive. Rather than locate functions empirically, by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">looking into the brain and correlating defects in mental attributes with lesions in specific regions following tumor or stroke</mark>, Gall <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">spurned all evidence derived from studies of brain lesions, whether discovered through clinical examination or produced surgically in experimental animals</mark>.

Influenced by physiognomy, the popular science based on facial features reveal character. Gall believed that the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bumps and ridges</mark> on the skulls of people well endowed with specific cognitive faculties identified the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">centers for those faculties in the brain</mark>. He assumed that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">size of an area of brain</mark> was related to the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">relative importance of the mental faculty represented in that area</mark>. (Exercising of the brain in certain aspects will grow those aspects and cause the skull to protrude).

In the late 1820s, Gall's ideas were subjected to experimental analysis. Concluded that specific brain regions are **NOT** responsible for specific behaviors, _but that all brain regions, especially the cerebral hemispheres of the forebrain, participate in every mental operation._ Injury to any one area of the cerebral hemisphere should therefore affect all higher functions equally.

The rapid acceptance of the _holistic_ view of the brain, was based only partly on the above work. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It also represented a cultural reaction against the materialistic view that the human mind is a biological organ</mark>. (Remove the notion of the soul)

The holistic view was seriously challenged in the mid-19th century. In his studies of **focal epilepsy**, a disease characterized by convulsions that begin in a particular part of the body, it was shown that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">different motor and sensory functions could be traced to specific parts of the cerebral cortex</mark>. 

Extended this to the view of _cellular connectionism_, where individual neurons are the signaling units of the brain and connect to one another in a precise fashion. Future work revealed that different behaviors are produced by different interconnected brain regions.

The first **important** evidence for localization emerged from studies of how the brain produces language. Before we consider the relevant clinical and anatomical studies, we shall first review the overall structure of the brain, including its major anatomical regions. This requires that we define some essential navigational terms to navigate the 3 dimensional nature of the brain and spinal cord.

**Navigation of the brain! NEED TO KNOW**

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A.</mark> _Rostral_ means toward the nose and _caudal_ toward the tail. _Dorsal_ means toward the back of the animal and _ventral_ toward the belly. 

When we talk about the brain stem and such, the _Rostral_ means towards the brain, _Caudal_ means toward the coccyx. _Ventral_ (anterior) means toward the belly. _Dorsal_ (posterior) means toward the back of the head.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">B.</mark> _Medial_ means toward the middle of the brain and _lateral_ toward the side.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">C.</mark> When brains are sectioned for analysis, slices are typically made in one of three cardinal plans: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">horizontal, coronal, or sagittal</mark>.




### Box 1-2 Anatomical Organization of the CNS

![[divisions of the CNS.png]]

**The Central Nervous System has Seven Main Parts**

The **spinal cord**, the most caudal part of the CNS, receives and processes sensory information from the skin, joints, and muscles of the limbs and trunk and controls movement of the limbs and the trunk. It is subdivided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions.
The spinal cord continues rostrally as the **brain stem**, which consists of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain</mark>. The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">brain stem receives sensory information</mark> from the skin and muscles of the head and provides the motor control for the head's musculature. It also conveys information from the spinal cord to the brain and from the brain to the spinal cord, and regulates levels of arousal and awareness through the reticular formation.

The brain stem contains several collections of cell bodies, the cranial nerve nuclei. Some of these nuclei receive information from the skin and muscles of the head; other control motor output to muscles of the face, neck, and eyes. Still others are specialized to process information from three of the special sense: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">hearing, balance, and taste</mark>.

The **[[Medulla Oblongata|medulla oblongata]]**, directly rostral to the spinal cord, includes several centers <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">responsible for vital autonomic functions, such as digestion, breathing, and the control of heart rate</mark>.

The **[[Pons|pons]]**, rostral to the medulla, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">conveys information about movement from the cerebral hemispheres to the cerebellum</mark>.

The **[[Cerebellum|cerebellum]]**, behind the pons, modulates the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">force and range of movement and is involved in the learning of motor skills</mark>. It is functionally connected to the three main organs of the brain stem: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain</mark>.

The **[[Midbrain|midbrain]]**, rostral to the pons, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">controls many sensory and motor functions</mark>, including eye movement and the coordination of visual and auditory reflexes.

The **[[Diencephalon|diencephalon]]** lies rostral to the midbrain and contains two structures. The _thalamus_ processes most of the information reaching the cerebral cortex from the rest of the CNS. The _hypothalamus_ regulates autonomic, endocrine, and visceral functions.

The **[[Cerebrum|cerebrum]]** comprises two cerebral hemispheres, each consisting of a heavily wrinkled outer layer (the cerebral cortex) and three deep-lying structures (components of the basal ganglia, the hippocampus, and amygdaloid nuclei). The basal ganglia, which include the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, regulate movement execution and motor- and habit-learning, two forms of memory that are referred to as implicit memory; the hippocampus is critical for storage of memory of people, places, things, and events, a form of memory that is referred to as explicit; and the amygdaloid nuclei coordinate the autonomic and endocrine responses of emotional states, including memory of threats, another form of implicit memory.
