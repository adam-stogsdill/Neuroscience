The first areas of the cerebral cortex identified as important for cognition were areas concerned with language.
These discoveries came from studies of **[[Aphasia|aphasia]]**, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a language disorder that most often occurs when certain areas of brain tissue are destroyed by a stroke, the occlusion or rupture of a blood vessel supplying a portion of the cerebral hemisphere</mark>.  ^dc572b

Many of the important discoveries in the study of aphasia occurred in rapid succession during the latter half of the 19th century. Leading to one of the most exciting chapters in neuroscientific study of human behavior.

Pierre Paul Broca, a French neurologist, was the first to identify specific areas of the brain concerned with language. Broca correlated clinical evidence of aphasia with brain lesions discovered post mortem. In 1861 he wrote, "I had thought that if there were ever a phrenological science, it would be the phrenology of **convolutions** (in the cortex), and not the phrenology of **bumps** (on the head)." Based on this insight Broca founded neuropsychology, an empirical science of mental processes that he distinguished from the phrenology of Gall.

In 1861 Broca described a patient, Leborgne, who as a result of a stroke could not speak but could also understand language perfectly well. There aren't anything that would hinder his ability from talking and was able to utter isolated words, whistle, and sing a melody without difficulty. He just had difficulty speaking grammatically, couldn't create complete sentences, and couldn't express his ideas in writing.

Postmortem examination of the patient's brain showed a lesion in a posterior inferior region of the left frontal lobe, now called [[Broca's Area]]. Broca then studied 8 different patients with similar cases and in those cases, the lesion was located in the left hemisphere. This discovery led him to announce in 1864, "Nous parlons avec l'hemisphere gauche!" (We speak with the left hemisphere!).

This work would encourage further work! In 1870 Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzip found that they <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">could move a dog's paw</mark> by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">electrically stimulating discrete regions of the precentral gyrus.</mark> They also found that the left hemisphere controlled the right side of the body (and vice versa).

In 1876, Karl Wernicke published a paper called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">"The Symptom-Complex of Aphasia: A Psychological Study on an Anatomical Basis."</mark> In it he describes another type of **aphasia**, a failure of comprehension rather than speech. (A _receptive_ malfunction as opposed to a _expressive_ one) 

While Broca's patients could understand language and be unable to generate language, Karl's patients did the opposite and could generate language but would not be able to understand it. The lesion that would cause this occurred in the posterior part of the cerebral cortex where the temporal lobe meets the parietal lobe. (i.e. Wernicke's area)

At the time **Phrenologists** and **cellular connectionists** argued that the *cerebral cortex was a mosaic of functionally specific areas*, whereas the **holistic aggregate-field school** claimed that _every mental function involved the entire cerebral cortex_.

Wernicke proposed that only the most basic mental functions (simple perceptual and motor activities) are mediated by neurons in discrete local areas of the cortex. More complex cognitive functions were the result of the interactions of several functional sites. Thus Wernicke was the first to advance the idea of _distributed processing_, which is now a central tenet of neural science.

Wernicke postulated that language involves separate **motor and sensory programs**, each governed by distinct regions of cortex. 
* Proposed that the motor program that governs the mouth movements for speech is located in Broca's Area
* _Wernicke's area_ would govern word perception to the temporal lobe area. This region is surrounded by the auditory cortex and by areas now known collectively as **association cortex**, integrating auditory, visual, and somatic sensations.
* According to Wernicke's model, the communication between these two language centers was mediated via large bundle of axons known as the **[[Arcuate Fasciculus | arcuate fasciculus]]**.

Thus Wernicke formulated the first coherent neural model for language that is still useful today, with important modifications and elaborations described in Chapter 55. According to this model, the neural processing of spoken or written words begins in separate sensory areas of the cortex specialized for auditory or visual information. This information is then conveyed, via intermediate association areas that extract features suitable for recognition of spoken or written words, to [[Wernicke's Area]], where it is recognized as **language and associated with meaning.**

The power of Wernicke's model was not only its <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">completeness</mark> but also its <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">predictive utility</mark>. 

The model was able to correctly predict a third type of _aphasia_, one that results from complete disconnection. Receptive and expressive zones for speech are intact but the neuronal fibers that connect them ([[Arcuate Fasciculus|arcuate fasciculus]]) are destroyed.  This type of aphasia is called **[[Conduction Aphasia|conduction aphasia]]**.

A new school of cortical localization arose in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century by Korbinian Brodmann. It distinguished functional areas of the cortex based on the shapes of cells and variations in their layered arrangement. Using this _cytoarchitectonic_ method, Brodmann distinguished 52 anatomically and functionally distinct areas in the human cerebral cortex.

![[early_cytoarchitecture.png|700]]

Because of studies that were conducted by people skeptical of cortex based interactions, we learned that it takes rather large lesions or damage to create obvious deficiencies in abilities. Such an observation would have seemed to support theories of mass action (the whole brain participates in actions), but we now recognized that it is compatible with **localization of function** that incorporates the idea of **redundancy of function**.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Soon the evidence for localization of function became overwhelming!</mark> 

Beginning in the late 1930s, Edgar Adrian and Wade Marshall and Philip Bard in the US discovered that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">touching different parts of the cat's body elicits electrical activity in distinct regions of the cerebral cortex</mark>. By systematically probing the body surface, they <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">established a precise map of the body surface in specific areas of the cerebral cortex</mark> described by Brodmann. ^c25608

This [[3 The First Strong Evidence for Localization of Cognitive Abilities Came From Studies of Language Disorders#^c25608|result]] showed that distinct areas of cortex could be _defined unambiguously according to anatomical criteria such as cell type and cell layering, connections of cells, and -most importantly- behavioral function._

As we see later, **functional specialization** is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">key organizing principle in the cerebral cortex</mark>, extending even to individual columns of cells within an area of cortex.

More refined methods made it possible to learn even more about the function of different brain regions involved in language. In the late 1950, Wilder Penfield (and later George Ojemann), **reinvestigated** the cortical areas that are essential for producing language.

While locally anesthetized during brain surgery for epilepsy, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">awake patients were asked to name objects (or use language in other ways)</mark> while different <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">areas of the exposed cortex were stimulated with small electrodes</mark>. If an area of the cortex was critical for language, application of electrical stimulus blocked the patient's ability to name objects. Using this technique, we were able to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">confirm the language areas of the cortex!</mark> (Broca and Wernicke's area.) However, we will learn that the neural networks for language are much more extensive and complex than Broca and Wernicke had described.

Back then almost **EVERYTHING** came from work researching patients with lesions. Now we can use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other noninvasive methods that allow us to observe a healthy brain when people are engaged in tasks (reading, speaking, and thinking). fMRI not only has confirmed that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reading and speaking activate different brain areas</mark> but also has revealed that just <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">thinking about a word's meaning in the absence of sensory inputs activated a still different area in the left frontal cortex</mark>.

Modern methodologies revealed that so many areas of cortex are activated in language comprehension and production. The areas include:
* Traditional language areas, identified by Broca, Wernicke, and Dejerine, in the left hemisphere
* Their homologs in the right hemisphere
* Newly identified regions

It appears that Broca's area, once thought to be dedicated to language production, is in fact also involved in a variety of linguistic tasks including comprehension. Functional imaging invites refinement or revision of the critical areas identified by lesion studies.

For example, reading is not thought to recruit specialized regions in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex in addition to the angular gyrus in the parietal cortex.

Thus the processing of language in the brain additionally exemplifies that numerous distinct neural structures with specialized functions belong to systems. The brain may carve up a task differently than our intuition tells us. (Who would have guessed that the neural analysis of the movement and color of an object would occur in different pathways rather than a single pathway mediating a unified percept of the object?)

Studies of patients with brain damage give us insight into how the brain is organized for language. One of the most impressive results comes from the study of deaf people who have lost their ability to communicate through the use of sign language after suffering cerebral damage. Damage to the left hemisphere can have very specific consequences for signing just as it would be for spoken language, affecting sign comprehension (following damage in Wernicke's area), grammar, or fluency (following damage in Broca's Area). 

Production and comprehension of signed and spoken languages do not involve identical brain areas, but the overlap is significant.

These observations illustrate three points.
1) <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Language processing occurs primarily in the left hemisphere</mark>, independently of pathways that process the sensory and motor modalities used in language.
2) <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Auditory input is not necessary for the emergence and operation of language</mark> capabilities in the left hemisphere
3) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Spoken language is only one</mark> of a family of language skills mediated by the left hemisphere

Investigations of other behavior have provided support for the idea that the brain has **distinct cognitive systems**. They demonstrate that complex information processing requires many interconnected cortical and subcortical areas.
