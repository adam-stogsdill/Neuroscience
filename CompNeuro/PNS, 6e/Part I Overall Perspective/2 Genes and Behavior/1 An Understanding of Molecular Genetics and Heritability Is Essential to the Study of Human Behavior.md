Many human psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases have genetic components. The extent to which <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">genetic factors account for traits in a population</mark> is called _heritability_.
(The strongest case for heritability is that identical twins tend to be more similar (concordant) for neurological and psychiatric traits than fraternal twins.)

In the Minnesota Twin Study, they found that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">despite great differences in their environment</mark>, twins shared predispositions for the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">same psychiatric disorders and even tended to share personality traits</mark>, like extraversion. This study provides considerable evidence that genetic variation contributes to normal human differences, not just to disease states.

Heritability for human diseases and behavioral traits is usually substantially less than 100%, showing environment is an important factor for acquiring diseases or traits. (For many neurological, psychiatric, and behavior traits from twin studies are around 50%, but can be higher/lower for specific traits).

These studies however do not tell us what genes are important and playing a role in these factors, so to do that we use experimental animals where the environment and genetic factors are tightly controlled.
