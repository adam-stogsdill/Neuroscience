Many human psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases have genetic components. The extent to which <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">genetic factors account for traits in a population</mark> is called _heritability_.
(The strongest case for heritability is that identical twins tend to be more similar (concordant) for neurological and psychiatric traits than fraternal twins.)
