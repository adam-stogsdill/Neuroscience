A simple form of social behavior has been analyzed in the roundworm _Caenorhabditis elegans_. (C. Elegans) These animals live in soil and eat bacteria.

Different wild-type strains exhibit profound <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">differences in feeding behavior</mark>. Animals from the standard strain exhibited solitary feeding, while other strains exhibited social feeding patterns. (As seen below)

The difference between **social** and **solitary** worms is caused by a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">single amino acid substitution</mark> in a single gene, a member of a large family of genes involved in signaling between neurons.

This gene, _npr-1_, encodes a neuropeptide receptor. Neuropeptides have long been appreciated for their roles in <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">coordinating behaviors across networks of neurons</mark>.
	* For example, a neuropeptide hormone of the marine snail _Aplysia_ stimulates a complex set of movements and behavior patterns associated with a single behavior, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">egg laying</mark>.
	* Mammalian neuropeptides have been implicated in **feeding behavior**, **sleep**, **pain**, and many other behaviors and physiological processes.
The existence of a mutation in the neuropeptide receptor means that this molecule is important for <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">generating the behavior</mark> **AND** g<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">enerating the variation between individuals</mark>.

Neuropeptide receptors have also been implicated in the regulation of mammalian social behavior.
	* Neuropeptides, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">oxytocin</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">vasopressin</mark>, stimulate mammalian affiliative behaviors such as **pair bonding** and **parental bonding with offspring**. 
	* In mice, oxytocin is required for **social recognition**.

### Prairie vs Motane Voles and the role of Oxytocin/Vasopressin

**Oxytocin** released in the brain of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">female prairie voles during mating stimulates pair-bond formation</mark>. Likewise **vasopressin** released in the brain of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">male prairie voles during mating stimulates pair-bond formation and paternal behavior</mark>.

Male motane voles <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">breed widely</mark> and do **not** engage in paternal behavior.

The difference between the male motane and prairie voles is in the differences in the expression of the V1a class of vasopressin receptors in the brain.
* In **prairie voles**, V1a vasopressin receptors are expressed at <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">high levels in specifically the ventral pallidum</mark>.
* In **montane voles**, the levels are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lower in the ventral pallidum</mark> but <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">higher in other brain regions</mark>.

Introducing the V1a vasopressin receptor gene from prairie voles into male mice, which behave more like montane moles, increases the expression of the V1a vasopressin receptor in the ventral pallidum and increases the affiliative behavior of the male mice toward females. **Differences between species and how they express the vasopressin receptor can contribute to differences in social behavior.**

Evolutionary changes in the pattern of expression of the V1a vasopressin receptor in the ventral forebrain have altered the activity of a neural circuit, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">linking the function of the ventral forebrain to the function of the vasopressin-secreting neurons that are activated by mating</mark>. As a result, social behaviors are altered.

We do not know the role this plays in **humans** but might play a role already.
