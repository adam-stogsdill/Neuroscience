A more subtle question about the role of genes in behavior is to ask which genetic changes may be responsible for behavioral variation among normal individuals. Work by Marla Sokolowski and her colleagues led to the identification of the first gene associated with variation in behavior among
normal individuals in a species.

Larvae of _Drosophila_ vary in activity level and locomotion. This is natural variation (not induced by any lab work). These traits are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">heritable</mark>.

Sokolowiski found that the difference between rover and sitter larvae lied in a single major gene, the _for_ (forager) locus. The _for_ gene encodes a single transduction enzyme, a protein kinase activated by cellular metabolite cGMP (cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate). 

**Many neuronal functions are regulated by protein kinases such as the cGMP-dependent kinase encoded by the _for_ gene.**

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Protein kinases are particularly significant at transforming short-term neural signals into long-term changes in the property of a neuron or circuit.</mark> 

Why would variability in signaling enzymes be preserved in wild populations of _Drosophila_, which typically include both rovers and sitters? Well, the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">variations in the environment create pressure for balanced selection for alternative behaviors</mark>. (Rovers expand colonies when overpopulation occurs, while sitters exploit the surplus of food more thoroughly)

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The for gene is also found in honeybees!</mark> As bees get older they become foragers that leave the hive. The _for_ gene is expressed at <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">high levels in the brains of active foraging honeybees</mark> and at <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">low levels in the brains of stationary honeybees</mark>.

The same gene controls variation in behavior in two different insects, but in different ways.
* In mosquito, _Drosophila_, variations in the behavior are expressed in different individuals
* In the honeybee, they are expressed in one individual at different ages.

**The difference illustrates how an important regulatory gene can be recruited to different behavioral strategies in different species.**
