Comparisons between human and animal genomes lead to a surprising conclusion: the unique human species <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">did not result from the invention of a unique new human genes</mark>. (Humans and chimpanzees are profoundly different in their biology and behavior, yet they share 99% of their protein-coding genes.)

This information means we have to believe that these ancient genes are somehow being regulated to produce novel human properties such as: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">complex thoughts and language</mark>. Because of these gene similarities **WE CAN STUDY GENES FROM ANIMALS INSTEAD OF HUMANS!!!** For example, a gene from a mouse that encodes an amino acid sequence similar to a human gene usually has a similar function to the _orthologous_ human gene.

Approximately one-half of the human genes have functions that have been demonstrated or inferred from orthologous genes in other organisms. 

A set of genes shared by humans, flies, and even unicellular yeasts:
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">encodes the proteins for intermediary metabolism</mark>
* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein</mark>
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">cell division</mark>
* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cytoskeletal structures, protein transport and secretion</mark>

Multicellular organisms have developed transmembrane receptors. They are used for <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">cell-to-cell communication in development</mark>, in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">signaling between neurons</mark>, and as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">sensors of environmental stimuli</mark>.

Many of the transmembrane receptors and DNA-binding proteins in humans are related to specific orthologous genes in other vertebrates and invertebrates.

By going through the shared genetic heritage of the animals, we can infer pathways for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">neuronal development, neurotransmission, electrical excitability, and gene expression</mark> were present in the common ancestor of worms, flies, mice, and humans. Studies of animal and human genes have demonstrated that the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">most important genes in the human brain are those that are most conserved throughout animal phylogeny</mark>. Differences between mammalian genes and their invertebrate counterparts most often result from gene duplication in mammals or subtle changes in gene expression and function, rather than the creation of entirely new genes.
