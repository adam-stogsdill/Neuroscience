**ALL** Behaviors are shaped by the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">interplay of genes and the environment</mark>. The most stereotypic behaviors of simple animals are influenced by the environment, while the highly evolved behaviors of humans are constrained by innate properties by genes.

Genes **DO NOT** control behavior directly, but <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">RNAs and proteins encoded by genes act at different times and at many levels to affect the brain</mark>. Genes specify the developmental programs that assemble the brain and are essential to the properties of neurons, glia, and synapses that allow neuronal circuits to function. Genes that are stably inherited over generations create the machinery by which new experiences can change the brain during learning.

In this chapter we ask, **how do genes contribute to behavior?**

A deep understanding of the ways that genes regulate behavior is through the study of worms, flies, mice, and other animals who genomes are accessible to experimental manipulation.

Recent developments has begun to reveal the genetic risk factors in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric syndromes such as autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, offering another important avenue to clarify the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">relationship between genes, brain, and behavior</mark>.
