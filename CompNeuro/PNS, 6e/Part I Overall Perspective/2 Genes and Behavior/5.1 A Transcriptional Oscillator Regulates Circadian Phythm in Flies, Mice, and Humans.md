The first large-scale studies of the influence of genes on behavior were around 1970, by Seymour Benzer. They used random mutagenesis and classical genetic analysis to identify mutatinos that affected learned and innate behaviors in the fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_, they studied these behaviors:
* Circadian (daily) rhythms
* courtship behavior
* movement
* visual perception
* memory

These induced mutations have had an immense influence on our understanding of the role of genes in behavior. ([[Box 2-2 Generating Mutations in Experimental Animals]] & [[Box 2-3 Introducing Transgenes in Flies and Mice]])
