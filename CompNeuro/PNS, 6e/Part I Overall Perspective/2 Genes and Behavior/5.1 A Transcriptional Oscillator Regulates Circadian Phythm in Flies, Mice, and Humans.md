The first large-scale studies of the influence of genes on behavior were around 1970, by Seymour Benzer. They used random mutagenesis and classical genetic analysis to identify mutatinos that affected learned and innate behaviors in the fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_, they studied these behaviors:
* Circadian (daily) rhythms
* courtship behavior
* movement
* visual perception
* memory

These induced mutations have had an immense influence on our understanding of the role of genes in behavior. These induced mutations have had an immense influence on our understanding of the role of genes in behavior.

We have a particularly complete picture of the genetic basis of the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">circadian control of behavior</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Circadian Rhythm</mark> â†’ couples a certain behaviors to a 24-hour cycle linked to the sun cycle. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Circadian behavior persists even in the absence of light or other environmental influences.</mark>

The circadian clock <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can be reset by light-driven signals transmitted by the eye</mark> to the brain. Lastly, the clock drives effector pathways for specific behaviors, such as <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">sleep and locomotion</mark>.

Benzer's group searched <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">thousands of mutant flies</mark> to look for rare flies that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">failed to follow circadian rhythms</mark> because of mutations in the genes that direct circadian oscillation. From this work emerged the first insight into the molecular machinery of the circadian clock. Mutations in the _period_, or _per_, gene affected all circadian behaviors generated by the fly's internal clock.

Interestingly, _per_ mutations could change the circadian clock in several ways. (Look at figure below)

Arrhythmic _per_ mutant flies, which exhibited no discernible rhythms in any behavior, lacked all function of the _per_ gene, so now we know that _per_ is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">essential for rhythmic behavior</mark>. _Per_ mutations that maintained some function of the gene resulted in abnormal rhythms. Thus _per_ is actually a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">timekeeper whose activity can change the rate at which the clock runs</mark>.

When there was a _per_ mutation, there were **no** other adverse effects (other than the change in circadian rhythm).

### How does per keep time????

The protein product PER is a [[Transcriptional Regulator|transcriptional regulator]] that affects the expression of other genes. Levels of PER are regulated throughout the day. Level so PER and its mRNA are low in the morning and reach peak quantities after dusk and at night.
