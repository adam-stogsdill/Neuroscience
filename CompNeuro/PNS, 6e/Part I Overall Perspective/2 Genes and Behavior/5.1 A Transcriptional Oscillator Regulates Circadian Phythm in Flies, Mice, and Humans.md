The first large-scale studies of the influence of genes on behavior were around 1970, by Seymour Benzer. They used random mutagenesis and classical genetic analysis to identify mutatinos that affected learned and innate behaviors in the fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_, they studied these behaviors:
* Circadian (daily) rhythms
* courtship behavior
* movement
* visual perception
* memory

These induced mutations have had an immense influence on our understanding of the role of genes in behavior. These induced mutations have had an immense influence on our understanding of the role of genes in behavior.

We have a particularly complete picture of the genetic basis of the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">circadian control of behavior</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Circadian Rhythm</mark> → couples a certain behaviors to a 24-hour cycle linked to the sun cycle. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Circadian behavior persists even in the absence of light or other environmental influences.</mark>

The circadian clock <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can be reset by light-driven signals transmitted by the eye</mark> to the brain. Lastly, the clock drives effector pathways for specific behaviors, such as <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">sleep and locomotion</mark>.

Benzer's group searched <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">thousands of mutant flies</mark> to look for rare flies that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">failed to follow circadian rhythms</mark> because of mutations in the genes that direct circadian oscillation. From this work emerged the first insight into the molecular machinery of the circadian clock. Mutations in the _period_, or _per_, gene affected all circadian behaviors generated by the fly's internal clock.

Interestingly, _per_ mutations could change the circadian clock in several ways. (Look at figure below)

Arrhythmic _per_ mutant flies, which exhibited no discernible rhythms in any behavior, lacked all function of the _per_ gene, so now we know that _per_ is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">essential for rhythmic behavior</mark>. _Per_ mutations that maintained some function of the gene resulted in abnormal rhythms. Thus _per_ is actually a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">timekeeper whose activity can change the rate at which the clock runs</mark>.

When there was a _per_ mutation, there were **no** other adverse effects (other than the change in circadian rhythm).

### How does per keep time????

The protein product PER is a [[Transcriptional Regulator|transcriptional regulator]] that affects the expression of other genes. Levels of PER are regulated throughout the day. Level so <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">PER and its mRNA are low in the morning</mark> and <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">reach peak quantities after dusk and at night</mark>. The levels then decrease, falling before the next dawn.

These observations are interesting because they show that there is a cycle of protein production that occurs throughout the day, but the issue is … <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">what makes PER cycle</mark>?

Further studies were conducted. This time with mice. Found that these new mutant mice had a single gene mutation that was called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clock</mark>.

When mice homozygous for the clock mutation are transferred to darkness, they initially experience extremely long circadian periods and later a complete loss of circadian rhythmicity. (Look at figure below!)

The clock gene seems to regulate two fundamental properties of the circadian rhythm:
1) Length of the circadian rhythm
2) Persistence of rhythmicity in the absence of sensory input
These properties are conceptually identical to the properties of the _per_ gene in flies.

Both the Mouse CLOCK and fly PER proteins share a domain called a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">PAS domain</mark>, characteristic of a subset of transcriptional regulators.

**This observation suggests that the same molecular mechanism -- oscillation of PAS-domain transcriptional regulation -- controls circadian rhythm in flies and mice.**

Both flies and mice use both clock and per genes to control their circadian rhythm. A group of genes, not one gene, are conserved regulators of the circadian clock.

In both flies and mice, the CLOCK protein is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">transcriptional activator</mark>. Together with a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">partner protein</mark>, it <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">controls the transcription of genes that determine behaviors such as locomotor activity levels</mark>.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ClOCK and its partner also stimulate the transcription of the per gene. however, PER protein represses CLOCK's ability to stimulate per gene expression, so as PER protein accumulates, per transcription falls.</mark>

The 24-hour cycle comes about because the accumulation and activation of PER protein is delayed by many hours after the transcription of _per_, a result of PER phosphorylation, PER instability, and interactions with other cycling proteins.

The molecular properties of per, clock, and related genes generate all properties essential for circadian rhythm.
1) The transcription of circadian rhythm genes varies with the 24-hour cycle: PER activity is high at night; CLOCK activity is high during the day.
2) The circadian rhythm genes are transcription factors that affect each other's mRNA level, generating the oscillations. CLOCK activates _per_ transcription and PER represses CLOCK function.
3) The circadian rhythm genes also control the transcription of other genes that in turn affect many downstream responses. For example, in flies, the neuropeptide gene _pdf_ controls locomotor activity levels.
4) The oscillation of these genes can be reset by light.
