The two copies of a particular autosomal gene in the individual are called [[Allele|alleles]]. If the two alleles are identical they are classified as *homozygous*. If there is a discrepancy due to mutations the person is *heterozygous* at that locus. Males are *hemizygous* (meaning they don't have the corresponding allele on the 'other' X chromosome because they only have one ðŸ˜­) for genes on the X chromosome.

A population can have a large number of alleles of a gene; for example, a single gene that affects human eye color, called OCA2, can have alleles that encode shades of blue, green, hazel, or brown. Because of this variation, we need to know the difference between genotype and phenotype.![[chromosomes.png]]

The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">genotype</mark> is the **genetic makeup** of the gene, while the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">phenotype</mark> is the outward **presentation** of that gene.

If a mutant phenotype is expressed only when both alleles of a gene are mutated, the resulting phenotype is called ***recessive***. This can also happen if they are carrying on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">different damaging allele in a given gene on each of their chromosomes</mark> (so-called *compound heterozygote*). Recessive mutations usually result from loss or reduction of a functional protein.

If a mutant phenotype results from a combination of one mutant and one wild-type allele (the original gene, unmutated), the phenotypic trait and mutant allele are said to be ***dominant***. Some mutations are dominant because 50% of the gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype ([[Haploinsufficiency|haploinsufficiency]]). Some dominant mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein or to the expression of the wild-type gene product at an inappropriate time or place; if this acts negatively to the normal protein product, it is called a ***dominant negative*** mutation.

Recent progress in gene discovery in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and epilepsy, has demonstrated that the human genome is more sensitive to [[Haploinsufficiency|haploinsufficiency]] than previously appreciated. However, while the complete inactivation of both copies of a gene typically has a reliable effect, the severity and manifestation of haploinsufficiency vary to a greater degree from individual to individual, a phenomenon known as *variable, partial, or incomplete penetrance*. 

Genetic variations that <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">disturb development, cell function, or behavior</mark> in humans fall on a continuum between <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">common alleles (polymorphisms)</mark>, which generally have <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">small individual effects on biology and behavior, and rare variants, which may have larger biological effects</mark>. While these categorizations are useful generalizations, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">there are nonetheless important cases in which common polymorphisms carry large disease risk.</mark> (Such as the common variation in the APOE gene, present in 16% of the population, results in a 4x increase in the risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease)

>[!Abstract] Mutation: The Origin of Genetic Diversity
>Mutations can result from damage to the purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA, mistakes during the DNA replication process, and recombinations that occur during meiosis.
>
>Changes in a single DNA base (also called a point mutation) within a coding region fall into five general categories:
>1) Silent Mutation â†’ Changes a base but not an obvious result
>2) Missense Mutation â†’ results in an amino acid in a protein being substituted for another; further being classified into two subclasses: mutations that are damaging to protein function and those that may be functionally neutral
>3) Nonsense Mutation â†’ a codon within the coding region specifying a specific amino acid is replaced by a stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product
>4) Canonical Splice Site Mutation â†’ changes a nucleotide that specifies the exon/intron boundary
>5) Frameshift Mutation â†’ small insertions or deletions of nucleotides change the reading frame, leading to the production of a truncated or abnormal protein
>   
>   Current literature states that the latter 4 mutations are often referred to as *likely gene disrupting (LGD) mutations*.
>   
>   The frequency of mutations increases when the organism is exposed to chemical mutagens or ionizing radiations during experimental genetic studies. Chemical mutagens usually result in point mutations while Ionizing radiation will induce large insertions, deletions, and translocations.
>In humans, point mutations occur at low spontaneous rate in oocytes and sperm, leading to mutations present in the child but not in either parent called **de novo** mutations.
>Each generation, between 70 and 90 single base changes are introduced into the entire genome (approximately 3 billion base pairs), of which one, on overage, will cause a missense or nonsense mutation in a protein-coding gene. In number of de novo point mutations is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">increased in the children of older fathers</mark>, whereas the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">frequency of larger chromosome abnormalities is increased in the children of older mothers</mark>.
>
>Certain sequences may be missing or repeated several times on a chromosome. When such variations encompass more than 1000 base pairs ( X â‰¥ 1000 bp ), they are called copy number variations (CNVs). Changes in more than a single base and less than 1000 base pairs ( 1 bp > X < 1000 ) are referred to as insertion/deletions(indels).
>
>The contribution of any genetic variation to a disease or syndrome may be refferred to as _simple_ (or _Menelian_) or _complex_.
>* A simple or Mendelian mutation is one that is sufficient to confer a phenotype without additional genetic risk. (like sickle cell anemia (which has a specific cell))
>* A complex genetic disorder is one in which genetic risk factors change the probability of a disease but are not fully causal. (Most complex disorders also involved a contribution from the environment.)
