### Tell Us About Yourself
I'm Adam Stogsdill. I have a bachelors degree in computer science focusing primarily on Artificial Intelligence. I'm a huge computer science nerd and have been programming since 5th grade. I love music, my favorite genres being Cool Jazz and Indie Pop, I know, weird combination.

### Why do you want to do a PhD?
A lot of things encouraged me to get a PhD. I think that the most important  reason though, is that I love learning! Honestly, I was pretty disappointed from my undergraduate experience. I studied a lot of computer science stuff starting in middle school so when I got their, it almost felt redundant and I didn't get much more out of it. I really wanted something more rigorous and exploratory. When I was in my program, I was also pretty disappointed by my peers. I felt like their was no passion that motivated to get their degree and for people who get computer science degrees its usually about the opportunities and the money that they get in the future. While I think that money is important, especially now, I think its also important to have a passion about what you are doing. I saw that when I was doing research. I got to meet a lot of PhD students who were genuinely interested in what they were studying. That is an environment that I want to be in. I want to be working on something I'm passionate about as well as be surrounded by those with passion as well.

### Why are you interested in this program?
Boston's Neuroscience program was one of the first to catch my eye. The thing that most entices me though it the emphasis on the word **interdisciplinary**. I'm a very collaborative person so the most important aspect to a program I want to enter would heavily emphasis this.
