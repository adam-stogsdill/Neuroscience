The Frontal Lobe (the brain has one on each side, of course) of the neocortex is, as its name implies, in the front. The frontal lobe gyrus just anterior to the central fissure (central sulcus) is the primary motor cortex.

Cells in the primary motor cortex (upper motor neurons) send their axons (outputs cables) down he spinal cord and connect directly to motor neurons that activate muscles (lower motor neurons).

>[!tip] Motor Map
>The “Motor Map” (called a homunculus) has some interesting properties. One is that the area of primary motor cortex devoted to driving muscles in the face and hands, for example, is proportionally much larger than the devoted to driving much larger muscles such as in the leg. This is because the muscles in areas like the face are more finely differentiated to allow very complex and subtle patterns of activation, whereas many large muscles mostly just vary in the amount of contraction of the entire muscle.

In humans, the prefrontal cortex takes up the majority of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex is the most posterior portion of the lobe, starting just anterior to the central sulcus. 

Moving from the primary motor cortex in the anterior direction, you have a series of regions that perform more and more abstract motor functions. The supplementary and premotor cortex areas are concerned with coordination and sequencing of movement of several muscles. Anterior to this are regions called the frontal eye fields, which are involved in visual attention.

The prefrontal cortex deals with the most abstract aspects of planning.

>[!abstract] Frontal Lobe Polarization
>Think of the frontal lobe, which is concerned with executing behavior, as “polarized” from anterior to posterior. Farthest back, at the central sulcus, are neural wires going almost directly to muscles. In front of that are areas that organize and sequence movements. In front of that are abstract planning levels. At these abstract levels, for example, you select from a variety of different strategies that may involve completely different muscles, muscles sequences, or, the decision to not move at all.

An area of the prefrontal cortex called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (because it’s toward top/dorsal and outside/lateral) is crucial for what is called **************working memory**************, the contents of your thought at any given time. Working memory is essential for all high-level cognitive functions, including decision making and problem solving.

Below and more medial to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is an area called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This area is essential for social decision making (social intelligence) and risk assessment.
