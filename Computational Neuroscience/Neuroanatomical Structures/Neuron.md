All the divisions of the nervous system are based universally on the functions of neurons. Neurons are specialized cells that process information.

All nervous systems in animal species have four basic types of functional cells: 

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Sensory Neurons</mark> â†’ Neurons that tell the rest of the brain about the external and internal environment.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Motor (and other output) neurons</mark> â†’ Motor neurons contract muscles and mediate behavior, and other output neurons stimulate glands and organs.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Projection neurons</mark> â†’ Communication neurons transmit signals from one brain area to another
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Interneurons</mark> â†’ The vast majority of neurons in vertebrates are interneurons involved in local computations. Computational neurons extract and process information coming in from the sense, compare the information to what's in memory, and use the information to plan and execute behavior. Each of the several hundred distinguishable brain regions contains several dozen distinct types or classes of computational interneurons that mediate the function of the brain area.

Sensory neurons detect energy and substances from inside and outside our bodies. Energy detectors include:

1.  Photoreceptors in the eye that detect light
2.  Auditory hair cells in the cochlea that detect sound
3.  Mechanoreceptors in the skin that detect pressure and vibration

Sensory cells that detect molecules include olfactory neurons in the nose and taste buds in the tongue

We also have detectors inside our bodies that detect body temp, CO2 levels, blood pressure, and other indications of body function. The central and autonomic nervous systems use the outputs of these internal sensors to regulate body function and keep it in homeostasis.

Sensory neurons are the most specialized of all neurons because they have unique mechanisms for responding to a particular type of energy or detecting a particular substance.

Most neurons are computation interneurons that receive inputs from other neurons and have outputs to other neurons. However, some neurons, like those listed in the preceding section are different:

- **Some neurons are specialized for sensation.** The input for these neurons comes from the world, not other neurons.
- **Some neurons send their output to muscles, glands, or organs instead of other neurons.** In this way, they spur action, which can be anything from secreting a particular hormone to regulate a bodily process to darting out the front door and across the lawn when you hear the ice-cream truck.

Donâ€™t Forget! Neurons are just [[1.0 Neuron Basics, Not just Another Cell in the Body#^8008f6|another cell in the body]]!

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Neural synaptic receptors receive information via little squirts of neurotransmitters from other neurons.</mark> ðŸ’¦

Each little squirt of neurotransmitter tells the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">postsynaptic receptor (the receptor on the receiving neuronâ€™s dendritic tree)</mark> a message from the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">presynaptic cell (the one doing the squirting).</mark>

For a receiving neuron, itâ€™s like listening to hundreds of brokers simultaneously on the floor of a stock exchange. Some of the brokers are squirting happy ðŸ˜€ messages about something and makes the postsynaptic neuron happy, or _excited_, while others are sending low-key messages that makes the postsynaptic neuron less excited or _inhibited_. Millisecond by millisecond, the excitement level of the postsynaptic neuron is determined by which inputs, among the thousands it receives, are active and how active they are.

>[!abstract] Activity
>The meaning of the activity (or excitement level) of a neuron is a function of who is talking to it and whom it is talking to. If our particular stockbroker neuron, for example, were listening to the output of other neurons talking about things like electrical wiring, certain mines in Chile, and production of pennies, our stockbroker neuron might embody information about the price of copper.
