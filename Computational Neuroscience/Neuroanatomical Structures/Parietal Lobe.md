Just posterior to the central sulcus is the parietal lobe. This lobe extends from the central sulcus back to a not very well structurally defined border with the occipital lobe. 

The parietal lobe contains neurons that receive sensory information from the skin and tongue, and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">processes sensory information from the ears and eyes that are received in other lobes.</mark>

The major sensory inputs from the skin:

- Touch
- Temperature
- Pain Receptors

These sensory inputs are relayed through the thalamus to the gyrus just posterior the central fissure, where a map of the skin exists. (Areas that are more sensitive are larger than areas that are less sensitive)

ðŸ’¡ The skin homunculus map closely resembles the primary motor cortex map. In order to execute a complex motor task like tying a knot, you need high touch sensitivity to guide the finally differentiated motor control.
