function: "There are no explicit functions for the gyrus but the folds that create the gyrus allow for higher surface area, thus more neurons!"

The Gryri are located at the top of the wrinkle of the brain! Some Gyri seem to be associated with particular function i.e. processing auditory input in the superior temporal sulcus.

ðŸ¤– Gyri are ridges or convolutions on the surface of the brain. These ridges are formed by the folding of the cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions such as thinking and decision making. The cerebral cortex is made up of millions of nerve cells, or neurons, which are organized into distinct layers and patterns. The gyri are the raised, or elevated, areas of the brain that are created by the folding of these layers. This folding allows the brain to fit inside the skull, and also increases the surface area of the cerebral cortex, allowing for more neurons and therefore more cognitive power.
