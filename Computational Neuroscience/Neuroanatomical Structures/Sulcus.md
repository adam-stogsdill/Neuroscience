The Sulci are located in between the wrinkles of the brain! Sometimes, sulci separate cortical lobes or functions, but in many cases, they don’t.

Some sulci separate parts of the brain, i.e. the central sulcus that separates the frontal and parietal lobes. However, these don’t necessarily have a function are a meant to just help reduce the area the the brain takes while maximizing its surface area.
