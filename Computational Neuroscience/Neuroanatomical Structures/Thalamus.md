Your thalamus is your body’s information relay station. All information from your body’s senses (except smell) must be processed through your thalamus before being sent to your brain’s cerebral cortex for interpretation.

The thalamus is a large mass of nuclei located in the center of the brain, just above the brainstem. It serves as a sort of "relay station" for sensory information, transmitting signals from the senses to the appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex for further processing. The thalamus is also involved in regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness.
