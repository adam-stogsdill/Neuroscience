The process that removes introns (noncoding portions) from transcribed RNAs. Exons (protein-coding portions) can be removed. Depending on which exons are removed, different proteins can be made from the same initial RNA or gene. Different proteins created in this way are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">splice variants</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">alternatively spliced</mark>.
