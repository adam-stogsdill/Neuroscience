#NerveClassification 
Contain oval soma, gives rise to two distinct processes:
1) A dendritic structure that receives signals from other neurons
2) an axon that carries information toward the CNS
Many sensory cells are bipolar. Receptor neurons that convey **touch**, **pressure**, and **pain** initially are bipolar cells, but the two processes fuse into a single continuous structure that emerges from a single point in the cell body, and the dendrites become functionally axons
