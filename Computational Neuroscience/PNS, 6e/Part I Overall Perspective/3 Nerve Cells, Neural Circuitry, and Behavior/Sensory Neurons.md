Carries information from the body's peripheral sensors into the nervous system for the purpose of both <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">perception and motor coordination</mark>.

## Afferent Neurons
Neurons that transfer sensory information from the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">periphery</mark> to the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">central nervous system</mark>. (Applies to all information regardless of sensation)

The term _sensory_ says afferent neurons convey information to the CNS from the:
1) <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Sensory Epithelia</mark>
2) <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Joint Sensory Receptors</mark>
3) <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Muscle</mark>
However, this has been expanded to include neurons in <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">primary and secondary cortical areas that respond to changes in a sensory feature</mark>.
