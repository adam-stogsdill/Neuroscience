The brain actively organizes sensory information for **perception**, **action**, **decision-making**, **aesthetic appreciation**, and **future reference** -- that is to say, *memory*. It does this while also ignoring and discarding information judiciously. All this is accomplished by interconnected nerve cells.

Individual nerve cells (neurons) are the basic signaling units of the brain. Humans contain about 86 billion, and can be <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">classified into at least 1000 different types</mark>. However, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">organization into anatomical circuits with precise function</mark> is what truly generates complex human behavior.

One key organizational principle of the brain it that it organizes nerve cells with similar properties can produce different actions because of the way they are **connected**.
