Although the name for these cells derives from the Greek word for glue, glia do not commonly hold nerve cell together. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Rather they surround the cell bodies, axons, and dendrites of neurons</mark>. These neurons do not form dendrites and axons.

Although they arise from the same embryonic precursor cells, they have the same membrane properties as neurons and thus are **NOT ELECTRICALLY EXCITABLE**.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Play a key role in allowing electrical signals to move quickly along the axons of neurons</mark>. They appear to also play an important role in guiding connectivity during early development and stabilizing new or altered connections between neurons that occur through learning.
