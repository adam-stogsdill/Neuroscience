#NerveClassification 
Typically have a single axon and many dendritic structures emerging from various points around the cell body. These cells can greatly vary in shape, especially in the length of their axons and in the extent, dimensions, and intricacy of their dendritic branching.

Usually the extend of branching correlates with the number of synaptic contacts that other neurons make onto them.
