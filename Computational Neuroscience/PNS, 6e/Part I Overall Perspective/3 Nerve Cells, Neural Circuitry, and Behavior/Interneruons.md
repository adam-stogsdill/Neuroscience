Interneurons contain the most amount of function in these Neuron categories which are separated into two classes:
1) Relay → These interneurons have long axons and convey <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">signals over considerable distances</mark>, from one brain region to another.
2) Local →  These have short axons because they form connections with **nearby** neurons in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">local circuits</mark>.

Since almost every neuron can be regarded as an interneuron, the term is often used to distinguish between a local circuit as opposed to neurons that project to a separate neural structure.
