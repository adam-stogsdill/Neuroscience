Nerve cells have complex shapes. The elaborate patterns of dendrites and the seemingly endless course of some axons made it extremely difficult to establish a relationship between these elements.

Through staining, we began to have a more coherent structure of the neuron. Because of Ramon y Cajal's examination of neurons, they deduced two other principles of neural organization that would prove particularly valuable in studying communication in the nervous system.

Neurons are classified into three large groups: 
1) Unipolar
2) Bipolar
3) Multipolar

Nerve cells are also classified into three major functional categories:
1) Sensory Neurons
2) Motor Neurons
3) Interneurons
