Genes affect many aspects of behavior. There are remarkable similarities in personality traits and psychiatric illnesses in human twins, even those raised separately.

A series of parallel advances have ushered in an era of remarkable opportunity to understand the relationship between **genes**, **brain**, and **behavior**. At the same time, progress in defining the genetic risk factors for human neuropsychiatric disorders has advanced considerably.

Among the many striking findings from recent genetic studies of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions is the overlap in genetic risks across a wide range of diagnostic boundaries.

In addition, for many other psychiatric conditions that have not yet seen the type of progress noted earlier, the calculus is straight forward: greater investment and larger sample sizes will lead to greater insight.

The last point, know the idea that **ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL** for the genomics of behavioral, developmental, and psychiatric disorders. The coming years should see deep insights into the biology of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, and perhaps therapies with the potential to help patients and their families.
