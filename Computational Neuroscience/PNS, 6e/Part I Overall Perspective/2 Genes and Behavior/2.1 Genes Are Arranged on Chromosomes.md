The genes in a cell are stored in <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">long, linear stretches of DNA</mark> called **chromosomes**.

Each gene in the human genome is located at a characteristic locus on a specific chromosome, and this genetic "address" can be used to associate biological traits with a gene's effects.

Most multicellular animals (including humans) are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diploid</mark>; meaning every somatic cell carries two complete sets of chromosomes. 1x ðŸ‘© 1x ðŸ‘¨

Humans have about 20,000 genes but only 46 chromosomes:
* 22 pairs of autosomes (chromosomes that are present in both males and females)
* and two sex chromosomes (2 X â†’ female, 1X1Y â†’ Male)

In addition to the genes on chromosomes, a very small number of an organism's genes are transmitted through <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">mitochondria</mark>, cytoplasmic organelles that carry out metabolic processes. Come from the ovum and are therefore transmitted from the mother.

Certain human disorders, including some neuromuscular degenerative diseases, some forms of intellectual disability, and some forms of deafness, are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA.
