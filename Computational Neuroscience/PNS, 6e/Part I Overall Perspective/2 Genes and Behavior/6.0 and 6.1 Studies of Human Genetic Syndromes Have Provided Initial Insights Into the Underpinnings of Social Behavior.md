## Brain Disorder in Humans Result from Interactions Between Genes and the Environment
The first gene discovered for a neurological disease in humans clearly illustrates the interaction of genes and environment in determining cognitive and behavioral phenotypes.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Phenylkeonuria</mark> (PKU) â†’ affects one in 15,000 children and results in severe impairment of cognitive function.
	* Children with this disease have **TWO** abnormal copies (heterozygous carrier individuals have no symptoms) of the PKU gene that codes for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">phenylalanine hydroxylase</mark>, the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine</mark>.
	* Accumulate <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">high blood concentrations of phenylalanine</mark> from dietary proteins, which leads to the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">production of toxic metabolites that interfere with neuronal function</mark>.

The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">PKU phenotype</mark> (intellectual disability) results from <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the interaction of the genotype</mark> (the homozygous pku mutation) and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the environment</mark> (the diet).

**The treatment is simple and effective developmental delay can be prevented by a low-protein diet.** The molecular and genetic analysis of gene function in PKU has led to dramatic improvements in the life of affected individuals.

Later chapters of this book describe many examples of single-gene traits which have led to insights into brain function and dysfunction.
