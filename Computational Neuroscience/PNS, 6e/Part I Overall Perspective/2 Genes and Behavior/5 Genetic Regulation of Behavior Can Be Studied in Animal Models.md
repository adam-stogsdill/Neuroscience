Because of the concept of evolutionary conservation between human and animal genes, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">studies in proteins, and neural circuits that underlie behavior, we are likely to also yield insights into these relationships in humans</mark>.

There are two important strategies to studying gene function:
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Classical Genetic Analysis</mark> → subjects are subjected to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mutagenesis</mark> with a chemical or irradiation that induces <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">random mutations and then screened for heritable changes that affects behavior of interest</mark>, say, sleep. Thus the pathway of discover in classical genetics <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">moves from phenotype to genotype, from organism to gene.</mark>
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reverse Genetics</mark> → A **SPECIFIC** gene of interest is targeted for alteration, a genetically modified animal is produced, and the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">animals with these altered genes are studied</mark>. Method of discovery moves from genotype to phenotype, from gene to organism.

These two experimental strategies and their more subtle variations form the basis of experimental genetics. Gene manipulation by classical and reverse genetics is conducted in experimental animals, not in humans.
