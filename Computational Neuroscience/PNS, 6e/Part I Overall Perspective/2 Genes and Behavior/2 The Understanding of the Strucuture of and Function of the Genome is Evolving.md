Molecular biology and transmission genetics are central to our modern understanding of genes. Here we try to summarize some key ideas in the field.

Genes are made of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid), and it is DNA that is passed on from one generation to the next. In most circumstances, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">exact copies of each gene are provided to all cells in an organism</mark> as well as to the succeeding generations through DNA replication.

>[!note] What about mutations?
>The rare exceptions to this general rule - **de novo** (new) mutations that are introduced into the DNA of either germline or somatic cells and that play an important role in disease risk - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">are discussed later</mark>.

**DNA is made of two strands**! Each of which has a **deoxyribose-phosphate backbone** attached to a series of four subunits: the nucleotides 
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Adenine (A)</mark>
* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Guanine (G)</mark>
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Thymine (T)</mark>
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Cytosine (C)</mark>

The two strands are paired so that an <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A on one strand is paired with a T</mark> on the complementary strand, and a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">G with a C</mark>. This complementarity ensures accurate copying of DNA during DNA replication and drives _transcription_ of DNA into lengths of RNA called transcripts

Given that nearly all of the genome is double-stranded, bases or base pairs are use interchangeably as a unit of measurement. A segment of the genome encompassing a thousand base pairs is referred to as 1 kilobase (1kb) or 1 kilobase pair (1kbp), whereas 1 million base pairs are 1 megabase (1Mb) or 1 Megabase pairs (1 Mbp)

RNA  differs from DNA in that it is **single-stranded**, has a ribose rather than a deoxyribose backbone, and uses the nucleoside <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">uridine</mark> (U) instead of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">thymine</mark> (T).

In the human genome, approximately 20,000 genes encode protein products, which are generated by _translation_ of the linear messengers RNA (mRNA) sequence into a linear polypeptide (protein) sequence composed of amino acids.

A typical <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">protein-coding gene consists of a coding region</mark>, which is translated into the protein and noncoding regions. The coding regions is usually arranged in small coding segments called [[Introns and Exons|exons]], which are separate by noncoding stretches called [[Introns and Exons|introns]]. The introns are deleted from the mRNA before its translation into protein.

Many functional RNA transcripts do not encode proteins. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">In fact, in the human genome, over 40,000 noncoding transcripts have been characterized as compared with approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes</mark>. Such genes include:
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ribosomal RNAs</mark> (rRNAs)
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">transfer RNAs</mark> (tRNAs)
these are essential to the machinery for mRNA translation.

Additional noncoding RNAs (ncRNS) include:
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">long noncoding RNAs (lncRNS)</mark>: arbitrarily defined as longer than 200 bp in length, that do not encode proteins but can have roles in gene regulation
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">small noncoding RNAs</mark>: 
	* Such as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">small nuclear RNAs</mark> {snRNAs}, that guide mRNA splicing
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">microRNAs</mark> (miRNAs) that pair with complementary sequences in specific mRNAs to inhibit their translation.

Each cell in the body contains the DNA for **every** gene but only expresses a specific subset of the genes as RNAs.

Parts of the gene that would be transcribed into RNA is surrounded by noncoding DNA regions that can be bound by other proteins, including **transcription factors**, to regulate gene expression.

These sequence motifs include:
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">promoters</mark>
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">enhancers</mark>
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">silencers</mark>
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insulators</mark>

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Promoters</mark> are typically found **close to the beginning of the region to be transcribed**; <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">enhancers</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">silencers</mark>, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insulators</mark> may reside a **distance from the gene** being regulated.

Each type of cell has a unique complement of DNA-binding proteins that interact with promotors and other regulatory sequences to regulate gene expression and the resulting cellular properties.

The **brain** üòè expresses a greater number of genes than any other organ in the body. Within the brain there is a **diverse population of neurons that express different groups of genes**.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">All the previous mechanisms allow a vastly large number of neuronal cell types and connections in the brain</mark>. ü§Ø

Although genes specify the initial development and properties of the nervous system, the experience of an individual and the resulting activity in specific neural circuits can itself alter the expression of genes. (Environmental influences can affect the structure and function of the neural circuits)
