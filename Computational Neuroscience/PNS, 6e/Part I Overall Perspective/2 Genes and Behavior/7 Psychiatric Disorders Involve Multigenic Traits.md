Single-gene syndromes are rare compared to the total burden of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disease. Studying the rare diseases can give us insights into the biological processes involved in more common, complex forms of a disease.

In the remainder of this chapter, we expand the discussion of the genetics of two complex neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes:
* autism spectrum disorders
* schizophrenia

Progress in understanding these disorders came from the combination of rapidly advancing genomic technologies and statistical methods, a culture of open data sharing, and the consolidation of very large patient cohorts providing adequate power to detect very rare highly penetrant alleles as well as common genetic variants carrying small increments of risk.
