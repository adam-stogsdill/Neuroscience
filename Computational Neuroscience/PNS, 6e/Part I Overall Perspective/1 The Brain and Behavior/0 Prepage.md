Above is an image showing the [[Computational Neuroscience/PNS, 6e/My Glossary/Corpus Callosum|Corpus Callosum]] and brainstem pathways. The image was constructed using MRI data with the diffusion spectrum imaging technique.

Diffusion spectrum imaging uses the rate and preferred direction of diffusion of water molecules to generate contrast in MR images to reveal axon bundles. The fibers are color coded by direction:
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Red</mark> → Left-right
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green</mark> → Anterior-posterior
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Blue</mark> → Ascending-Descending

During the second half of the 20th century, the central focus of biology was the gene. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Now the focus has shifted to neural science</mark>.

How does the brain - an organ weighing only 1.5 kg - conceive of the infinite, discover new knowledge, and produce the remarkable individuality of human thoughts, feelings, and actions?

How are these extraordinary mental capabilities distributed within the organ?

What rules relate the anatomical organization and the cellular physiology of a region to its specific role in mentation?

What do genes contribute to behavior, and how is gene expression in nerve cells regulated by developmental and learning processes?

How does experience alter the way the brain processes subsequent events, and to what degree is that processing unconscious?

Finally, what are the neural bases of neurological and psychiatric disorders?

In this intro section of the book _Principles of Neural Science_, we begin to link the computational logic of neural circuitry to the mind (how the activities of nerve cells within defined neural).

In the first part of this book, we consider the degree to which mental functions can be localized to specific regions of the brain. We also examine the extent to which such functions can be understood in terms of properties of: 
* individual nerve cells
* their molecular constituents
* and their synaptic connections. 

In the later parts of this book, we examine in detail the mechanisms underlying cognitive and affective functions of the brain:
* perception
* action
* motivation
* emotion
* learning
* memory

The human brain is a network of more than 80 billion individual nerve cells interconnected in systems - neural circuits - that construct our perceptions of the external world, fix our attention, guide our decisions, and implement our actions.

One of the chief ideas we shall develop in this book is that the specificity of the synaptic connections established during development and refined during experience underlie behavior. We can also learn to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">understand both the innate and environmental determinants of behavior in which genes encode proteins</mark> that initially govern the development of the neural circuits that can then be modified by experience-dependent changes in gene expression.

Our goal is to provide not simply the facts but the principles of brain organization, function, and computation. The principles of neural science <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">do not reduce the complexity of human thought to a set of molecules or mathematical axioms.</mark> Rather, they allow us to appreciate a certain beauty - a Darwinian elegance - in the complexity of the brain that accounts for mind and behavior. 


## Introduction
The last frontier of the biological sciences is to understand the basis of consciousness and the brain processes by which we:
* feel 
* act
* learn
* remember

During the past few decades, a remarkable unification within the biological sciences has set the stage for addressing this great challenge.

The ability to sequence genes and infer the amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode has revealed unanticipated similarities between proteins in the nervous system and those encountered elsewhere in the body. As a result, it has become possible to establish a general plan for the function of cells, a plan that provides a common conceptual framework for all of cell biology, including cellular neural science.

The current challenge in the unification within biology is the unification of:
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">psychology</mark> → the science of the mind
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">neural science</mark> → the science of the brain.
This unification can only exist if we find that all behavior is the result of brain function (which is what we are largely running on in our assumptions).

Brain processes underlie all function, from the simple <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">motor behaviors</mark> (walking and eating) to more difficult and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complex cognitive acts</mark> (thinking, speaking, and creating works of art).

Neural science must continually confront certain fundamental questions.
* What is the appropriate level of biological description to understand a thought process, the movement of a limb, or the desire to make the movement?
* Why is a movement smooth or jerky or made unintentionally in certain neurological disease states?

Answers to these questions might emerge from looking at the pattern of DNA expression in nerve cells and how this patter regulates the electrical properties of neurons. However, we will also require knowledge of neural circuits comprising many neurons in specific brain areas and how the activity of specific circuits in many brain areas is coordinated.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Is there a level of biological description that is most apt? It depends</mark>
If you want to **understand** and **treat** certain _genetic epilepsy disorders_, then DNA sequencing and measurements of electrical properties of individual neurons might be sufficient to produce an effective therapy.
If you are interested in **learning**, **perception** and **exploration**, then an analysis of _systems of circuits and brain regions_ is likely required.

The effort of integrating these specialized levels into a single "science" forces us to ask a _few questions_.
* If mental processes can be localized to discrete brain regions, what is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">relationship between the functions of those regions and the anatomy and physiology of those regions</mark>?
* Is one kind of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">neural circuit required to process visual information, another type to parse speech, and yet another to sequence movements</mark>?
* Do <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">circuits with different functions</mark> share <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">common organizational principles</mark>?
* Are the requisite <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">neural computations</mark> best understood as operations on information represented by <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">single neurons</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">populations of neurons</mark>?
* Is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">information represented in the electrical activity of individual nerve cells</mark>, or is it <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">distributed over ensembles such that any one cell is no more information than a random bit of computer memory</mark>?

To understand these points we shall examine how modern neural science describes **language**, a distinctive cognitive behavior in humans. To do this, we will focus on operations in the **cerebral cortex**. We shall see how the cortex is organized into distinct regions, each with large groups of neurons, and how the neural apparatus of a highly complex behavior can be analyzed in terms of the activity of specific sets of interconnected neurons within specific regions.
