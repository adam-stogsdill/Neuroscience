The CNS is a bilateral and largely symmetrical structure with two main parts, the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">spinal cord and brain</mark>. The brain comprises six major structures:
1) The medulla oblongata
2) pons
3) cerebellum
4) midbrain
5) diencephalon
6) cerebrum

In the medulla, pons, midbrain, and diencephalon, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">neurons are often grouped in distinct clusters termed nuclei</mark>.

In each of the hemispheres, the overlying cortex is divided into four lobes:
1) Frontal
2) Parietal
3) Occipital
4) Temporal

Each lobe has characteristic deep infoldings (i.e. the sulci/fissures and gyri).

Each lobe has specialized functions.

* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frontal</mark> → largely concerned with short-term memory, planning future actions, and control of movement.
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Parietal</mark> → mediates somatic sensation, forming a body image and relating it to extrapersonal space
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Occipital</mark> → concerned with vision
* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Temporal</mark> → processes hearing, the recognition of object and faces and (through the hippocampus and the amygdaloid nuclei) learning, memory, and emotion.

Two important features characterize the organization of the cerebral cortex:
1) Each hemisphere is concerned primarily with sensory and motor processes on the contralateral (opposite) side of the body.
2) The hemispheres, although similar in appearance, are not completely symmetrical in structure or function.
