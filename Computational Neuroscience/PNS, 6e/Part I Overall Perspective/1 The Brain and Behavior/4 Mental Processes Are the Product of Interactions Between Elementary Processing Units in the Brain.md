There are several reasons why this now elementary idea was being rejected in the past. Phrenologists introduced the idea of localization in an **exaggerated** form and **without adequate evidence**. Flouren's rejection of phrenology and the ensuing debate between proponents of the aggregate-field view (against localization) and the cellular connectionists (for localization) were responses to a theory that was _simplistic_ and _without adequate experimental evidence_.

With Wernicke's work we now believed that all cognitive abilities result from the interaction of many processing mechanisms distributed in several regions of the brain (our brain consists of _elementary processing units_). This meant that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">damage to a single area should not result in a complete loss of a cognitive function</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A more realistic metaphor about how the brain works is that of a process consisting of several parallel pathways in a network of modules that interact and ultimately converge upon a common set of targets.</mark>

Modular processing in the brain was slow to be accepted because, until recently, it was difficult to demonstrate white components of a mental operation were mediated by a particular pathway or brain region. However, using modern cognitive psychology and brain science, we have been able to appreciate that mental function can be broken down into subfunctions.

To illustrate this point, consider how we **learn, store, and recall information about objects, people, and events**. Our own experience would say that apples would be store in a single complete representation (one that has all the components of apple readily available). However, this is not true! Knowledge about <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">apples</mark> is not store as a single coherent representation but rather is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">subdivided into distinct categories and store separately</mark>.

One region of the brain stores information about the way you would hold the apple, the way you would feel for softness, the color, the way you might communicate the presence or taste of the apple to another person, as well as its semantic association with computers, physicists, worms, serpents, and biblical gardens. We know that a variety of neural structures from various parts of the brain are what help us create this idea of an apple. (Even consciousness, or the sense of self is not a unitary process).

The main reason it has taken so long to understand which mental activities are mediated by which regions of the brain is that we are dealing with biology's deepest riddle: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the neural mechanisms that account for consciousness and self-awareness</mark>. (Currently no theory that explains why only some information that reaches our eyes leads to a state of subjective awareness of an item, person, or scene).

Because of the gap in our understanding about the brain, we may make some assumptions due to experience that are not necessarily true in a neural sense. The insight that many cognitive functions transpire without conscious awareness raises the possibility that principles of neural science revealed in the study of more rudimentary behaviors can furnish insight into more complex cognitive processes.

To analyze how the brain gives rise to a specific mental process, we must determine not only which aspects of the process depend on which regions of the brain, but also how the relevant information is represented, routed, and transformed. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Modern neural science seeks to integrate such understanding across many scales</mark>.

Indeed, the excitement evident in neural science today stems from the conviction that the biological principles that underlie human thought and behavior are within our grasp and may soon be harnessed to elucidate and improve the human condition.
