A single copy of the wild-type allele at a locus in heterozygous combination with a variant allele is insufficient to produce the wile-type phenotype.

Say A+ is the dominant gene and A- is the mutation. Normally if the person has a heterozygous combination (A+A-) they can still have the A+ phenotype but instead they do not. That is an example of haploinsufficiency in play.
