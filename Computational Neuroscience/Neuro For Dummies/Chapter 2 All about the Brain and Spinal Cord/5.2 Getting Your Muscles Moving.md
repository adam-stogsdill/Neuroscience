How do muscles work? Muscles are groups of cells connected to each other in long parallel chains the ends of which are connected to bones by tendons.

The muscle cells contain chains of proteins called _actin_ and _myosin_. When these proteins are stimulated, they slide over each other, causing the cell to contract along its length.

Alpha motor neurons provide the stimulation by releasing the motor neuron neurotransmitter _acetylcholine_. When the acetylcholine is received by the receptors on the muscle cells, it causes a muscle cell action potential that cause the actin-myosin to slide which in turn causes the contraction.
