The fundamental unit of coordinated action mediated by the spinal cord is the spinal reflex. Striking the kneecap stretches the quadriceps muscle, as though oneâ€™s knees were buckling. Muscle spindle receptors in the quadriceps project to the spinal cord, and, through interneurons, activate alpha motor neurons that contract the muscle to maintain upright posture.

ðŸ§  Alpha motor neurons are the neurons that innervate muscle cells, which in turn move the limbs. The motor neurons have their cell bodies in the ventral (toward the stomach side of the body) part of the spinal cord. The axons that drive the muscles exit the spinal cord via a tract called the _**ventral root.**_

The axons of the sensory cells, such as stretch receptors, are located on the dorsal side of the spinal cord and enter via the dorsal root.

What doesnâ€™t the above figure show?

- **The original message gets sent to the brain**. (the signal gets shot up the spinal cord to the somatosensory cortex, just posterior to the central sulcus.)
- **Command messages come down from the brain**. Cortical neurons (otherwise known as upper motor [[Neurons]]) from the primary motor cortex come all the way down the spinal cord and synapse on the same alpha motor neurons that innervate muscles for the stretch reflex to you allow you to voluntarily extend your leg.
- **Communication occurs between segments**.  Motor segments send messages to other segments to coordinate body actions. (for example, if you were standing while your left leg started to buckle at the knee, your right leg would probably stiffen in compensation, and you would probably extend your left hand up, among other things.) These connections are also involved in the central pattern generator control of gait mentioned previously.
