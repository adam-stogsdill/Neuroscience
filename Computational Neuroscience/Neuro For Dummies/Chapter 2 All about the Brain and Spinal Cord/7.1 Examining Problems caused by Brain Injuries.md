The first early clues about the function of the brain came from dysfunction associated with head injuries.

In the early 20th century, the scientific study of the brain began advancing significantly with the study of _cytoarchitectonics_ (using stains to evaluate cell versus tract structure in various parts of the brain), and _tract tracing_, determining the connections between one area of the brain and another by tracing the axonal processes of cells. 

Early tract tracing often involved seeing where secondary degeneration occurred after damage to an area the secondary area was connected to. Silver stains such as the Golgi stain allowed researchers to see the structure of individual neural cells in great detail.
