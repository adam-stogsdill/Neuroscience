The grooves in the neocortex are called the sulci (singular: sulcus), and the ridges between the grooves are called gyri (singular: gyrus). No real difference exists between the neocortical tissue visible on the surface gyri versus that down in the sulci.

Generally areas that are close to each other in the brain interact the most with each other. However, any brain area can interact with other areas.

Some of the sulci separate parts of the brain that do different things. (The central sulcus separates the frontal lobe form the parietal lobe.), and some gyri seem to be associated with particular functions (such as processing auditory input in the superior temporal sulcus) but generally these don’t have specific functions and are meant to just optimize the space the brain takes up in the skull.

Each person’s brain can vary drastically when it comes to the gyri and sulci thus its hard to understand the “function”. The neocortex is the majority of what’s called the **telencephalon,** which means something like “highest” brain area.

The image also shows other structures in the neocortex.

>[!note] Remember!
>The surface of the neocortex everywhere consists of six layers of cells, the dendrites of those cells, and axons going to and from those cells to subcortical structures and other cortical areas.

This surface sheet contains the same six layers with the same cell types not only everywhere in the neocortex of a given species, but across all mammalian species.

Underneath this is the white matter layer (is actually lighter than the surface cellular layers). The white matter consists of almost exclusively axons. Most of the volume of the brain is wiring, not cells.
