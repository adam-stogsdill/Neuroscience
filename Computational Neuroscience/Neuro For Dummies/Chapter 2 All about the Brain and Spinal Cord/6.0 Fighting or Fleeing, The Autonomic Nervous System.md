The autonomic system controls the heart, glands, and organs with smooth muscles(not under voluntary control) such as the intestines. It has sensory, motor, and gland-stimulating components.

There are two divisions within this system. The **sympathetic** and the **parasympathetic** that often act in opposition to each other.

The sympathetic system prepares the body for immediate action (fight or flight), at the expense of body regulating functions such as digestion. 

These two systems use opposing neurotransmitters:

(norepinephrine/noradrenaline) → Sympathetic branch

Acetylcholine → Parasympathetic branch

These often work against each other, for example, norepinephrine speeds up the heart while acetylcholine slows it down.

Norepinephrine {from the sympathetic branch} also dilates the pupil and lung bronchi, decreases digestive functions, and inhibits bladder contraction and blood flow to the genitals. Many of these actions are mediated through the **adrenal medulla**. 

>[!tip] Overstimulation
>Overstimulation of the sympathetic system from excessive stress is hard on the body and tends to be associated with heart disease and other stress-related chronic illness. The chronic stress of modern life may result in sympathetic overstimulation.
