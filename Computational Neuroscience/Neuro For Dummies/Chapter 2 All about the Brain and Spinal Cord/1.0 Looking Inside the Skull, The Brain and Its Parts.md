The most complex structure in the universe (that we know of) is the three-pound mass of cells within your skull called the brain. The brain consists of about 86 billion neurons, which is about the same number of stars in our Milky Way galaxy and the number of galaxies in the known universe.

Like any complex machine, the brain contains a lot of parts, each of which have subparts which have themselves subparts, all the way down to the “nuts and bolts” - the neurons. 

>[!Note] There are four major lobes:
>1. Frontal
>2. Parietal
>3. Temporal
>4. Occipital

The following sections take a look at different parts of the brain, from top to bottom.
