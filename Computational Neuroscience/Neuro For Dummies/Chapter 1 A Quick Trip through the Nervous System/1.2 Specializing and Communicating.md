In multicellular organism, the environment of cells on the inside of the cell group is different from the environment of the cells on the outside of the group. (Human cell groups are organized against the outside cell groups) Each environment requires the cells form to develop a way to specialize and communicate.

If we imagine a clump of cells in an ocean billions of years ago, we can see how the cells towards the center of the ball could function better at some digestive task or other functions more effectively because they aren't exposed to the seawater. Then there are a group of cells that need to perform the waste removal process.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Eukaryotic</mark> cells specialized by **regulating DNA expression differently for cells inside the ball of cells versus those on the outside.**

Eventually those balls of cells had gained nervous systems that had become capable of moving in a coordinated fashion. What happened is that the mammals evolved with a particular brain circuit expanded enormously and created an additional processing layer laid over the top of the brain held by birds and reptiles, originally for both sensory processing and motor control.

With the expansion of the neocortex, the rest of the original components of the brain growing smaller. This occurred despite the fact that large brains are *expensive*, metabolically.

All the divisions of the nervous system are based universally on the functions of neurons. *Neurons* are specialized cells that process information. 

All nervous systems in all animal species have four basic types of basic types of functional cells:

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Sensory neurons</mark>: Neurons that tell the rest of the brain about the external and internal environment.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Motor (and other output) neurons</mark>: Motor neurons contract muscles and mediate behavior, and other output neurons stimulate glands and organs.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Projection neurons</mark>: Communication neurons transmit signals from one brain area to another.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Interneurons</mark>: The vast majority of neurons in vertebrates are interneurons involved in local computations. Computational interneurons extract and process information coming in from the sense, compare the information to what's in memory, and use the information to plan and execute behavior. Each of the several hundred distinguishable brain regions contains several dozen distinct types or classes of computational interneurons that mediate the function of the brain area.

The thing that makes the nervous system unique from other groups of cells is the vast and complex systems of neuronal interconnections. The human brain has about 86 billion neurons, each with a unique set of about 10,000 synaptic inputs from other neurons, yielding about a quadrillion synapse - a number even larger than the U.S. national debt in pennies. 

The number of distinct states of this system is virtually uncountable.

## Computing in circuits, segments, and modules

The largest part of the brain (the thing you see from the top and sides) if the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">neocortex</mark>. The neocortex is really 1 .5 ft^2 sheet of cells wadded up a bit to fit inside the head. The neurons form a complex neural circuit that is repeated millions of times on the surface. 

![Circuit Organization](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/numenta/original/2X/0/0a95eadeec717586b66cbb80e717e394a3d4c4c0.jpeg)

This repeated neural curcuit is called a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">minicolumn</mark>.

The brain contains many specialized areas associated with particular senses (vision versus audition, for example) and other areas mediating particular motor outputs (like moving the leg versus the tongue). The function of different brain areas depends not on any particular structure of the minicolumns within it, but its inputs and outputs.

Many parts of the nervous system are also made up of repeated circuits or circuit modules, although these are different in different parts of the brain:
	>> **The spinal cord** consists of very similar segments (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and so on), whose structure is repeated from the border of the medulla at the top of the spinal cord to the coccygeal segments at the bottom. 
	>> **The Cerebellum**, a prominent brain structure at the back of the brain below the neocortex, is involved in fine-tuning motor sequences and motor leanring. Whithin the cerebellum are repeated neural circuits forming modules that deal with motor planning, motor execution, and balance.

(Note: Neocortex refers to a part of the cerebral cortex concerned with sight and hearing in mammals, regarded as the most recently evolved part of the cortex while cerebral cortex refers to the outer layer of the cerebrum composed of folded grey matter and playing an important role in consciousness. Thus, this is the main difference between neocortex and cerebral cortex.)

All the modules that make up the central nervous system are extensively interconnected. The sections of the brain have more *white matter* or pale-appearing *axon tracts* (the neural "wires" that connect neurons to each other) than darker *gray matter* (neural cell bodies and dendrites, which recieve inputs from other nerons and do the neural computations).

![White matter](https://www.spinalcord.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gray%20matter,%20white%20matter%20(1).jpg?width=960&name=gray%20matter,%20white%20matter%20(1).jpg)

This is *why*: The brain uses local interconnections between neurons to do *computations* in neural circuits. However, any single neuron contacts only a factor of the other neurons in the brain. To get to other brain modules for other computations, the results of tehse computations must be sent over long distance projections via axon tract of communication neurons.

## What a charge: The role of electricity

Most neurons are cells specialized for computation and communication. They have two kinds of branches: *dendrites* (which normally receive inputs from other neurons) and *axons* (which are the neuron's output to other neurons or other targets, like the muscles) emanating from their cell bodies.
	>> Neuronal dendrites may be undreds of micrometers in length
	>> Neural axons may extend a meter (for example, axons run from single cells in the primary motor cortex in your brain down to the base of your spinal cord).

Because the neuron is lengthened by the dendrites and axons, if the neuron is going to process signals rapidly, it needs mechanisms to help that intracellular communication along.  **Electricity**! Whose conduction down the axon is aided by myelin wrapping from glial cells. 

![Myelin](https://neuroscientificallychallenged.com/files/images/myelin.jpg)

Neurons use electicity to communicate. The basic ide is that inputs spread out all over the dendrites and cause *current flow* from the dendrites into the cell body. The cell body converts this changing electrical current into a set of *pulses* sent down its axon to other neurons.

## Understanding the Nervous System's Modular Organization

The nervous system has an overall modular organization. Neruons participate in local circuits consisting of several hundred neurons composed of a dozen or two (or three, or sometimes four!) different types of neurons. These local circuits perform neural computations on inputs to the circuit and send the results to other circuits as outputs via projection neurons.
