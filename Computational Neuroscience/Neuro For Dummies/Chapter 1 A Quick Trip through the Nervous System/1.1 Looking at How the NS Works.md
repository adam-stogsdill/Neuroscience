The brain consists of different regions. The brain does not appear to be an amorphous mass of neural tissue that simply fills up the inside of the skull.

Given the appearance of the brain, you can ask two very important and related questions:
	>> Do the different regions of the brain that look different really do different things?
	>> Do the regions that look the same do the same thing?

The answer to both questions? Sort of.

## The Important role of Neurons

The nervous system, consists of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">central nervous system</mark> (the brain, retina, and spinal cord), the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">peripheral nervous system</mark> (the sensory and motor nerve axons that connect the central nervous system to the limbs and organs.) The peripheral nervous system also includes the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">autonomic nervous system</mark> (which regulates body processes such as digestion and heart rate), and the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">enteric nervous system</mark>, which controls the GI system.
