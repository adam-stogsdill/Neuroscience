In the early history of neuroscience, there were two theories about the brain's functionality.
	>> Phrenology Theory
	>> Aggregate Field Theory

The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Aggregate Field Theory</mark> supposed that, for the most part, the brian is a single, large neuronal circuit whose capabilities are related mostly to its total size. These theories assumed that the brain's internal structure is of little consequence in understanding its function.

The Phrenology theory, believed that almost every human characteristic, including things such as cautiousness, courage, and hope, are located in specific parts of the brain. They believed that you could measure the growth of thses attributes can be determined by measuring the height of the skull over those areas, believeing that the underlying brain grows and pushes the skull upward for traits that are highly developed.
