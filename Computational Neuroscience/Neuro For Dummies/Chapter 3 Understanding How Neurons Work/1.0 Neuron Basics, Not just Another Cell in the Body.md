First of all, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">neurons are cells!</mark>

They consist of a bag of cytoplasm with a membrane separating their cytoplasm from the outside world. Within this cytoplasm are organelles, such as mitochondria that provide energy for the cell, and structures, such as the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, that manufacture and distribute protein. ^8008f6

Here’s what makes neurons different from other cells!
	* A membrane with selective ion channels that can be opened by electrical events or binding by neurotransmitters
	* Dendrites, branching extensions from the cell body that receive inputs from other neurons
	* An axon, a single extension from the cell body that travels long distances (up to several feet) to contact other neurons

The figure above details the anatomy of the neuron. Neurons typically have a “dendritic tree” of branches (or processes) arising from the cell body (or _soma_), plus a single process called an _axon_ that  also emanates from the cell body but runs for large distances (sometimes even up to several feet) before it branches. 

The membrane that encloses a neuron’s cell body, axon, and dendrites is very different from the membrane that encloses most other cells because of its multiple types of ion channels.
