The referenced image illustrates intracellular and extracellular methods for recording neuronal responses electrically (they can also be recorded optically).

Membrane potentials are measured intracellularly by connecting a hollow glass electrode filled with a conducting electrolyte to a neuron, and comparing the potential it records with that of a reference electrode place in the extracellular medium.

Intracellular recordings are made either with:
* <mark style='background:#0fb9b1'>sharp electrodes</mark> → inserted through the membrane into the cell
* <mark style='background:#f7b731'>patch electrodes</mark> → have broader tips and are sealed tightly to the surface of the membrane.

The **top trace** in the referenced figure is a schematic of an intracellular recording from the soma of a neuron firing a sequence of action potentials. The recording shows rapid spikes riding on top of a more slowly varying subthreshold potential.

The **bottom trace** is a schematic of an intracellular recording made some distance out on the axon of the neuron. These recording are usually very difficult and rare, thus these images are drawings.

The **middle trace** illustrates an idealized, noise-free extracellular recording. Here an **electrode** is placed near a neuron but it does not penetrate the cell membrane. Such recordings **CAN** reveal the APs fired by a neuron, but **NOT** its subthreshold membrane potentials.
