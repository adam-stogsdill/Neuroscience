Under resting conditions, the potential inside the cell membrane of a neuron is about -70 mV relative to that of the surrounding bath, and the cell is said to be <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">polarized</mark>. Ion pumps located in the cell membrane maintain concentration gradients that support this <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">membrane potential</mark> difference. (Ions flow into and out of the cell due to both voltage and concentration gradients)

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Hyperpolarization</mark> → Current in the form of positively charged ions flowing out of the cell (or negatively charged ions flowing into the cell) through open channels makes the membrane potential more negative.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Depolarization</mark> → Current flowing into the cell changes the membrane potential to less negative or even positive values.
