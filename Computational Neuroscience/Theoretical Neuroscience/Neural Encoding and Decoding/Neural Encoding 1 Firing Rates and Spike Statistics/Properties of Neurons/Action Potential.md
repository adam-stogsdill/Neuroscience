If a neuron is depolarized sufficiently to raise the membrane potential above a threshold level, a positive feedback process is initiated, and the neuron generates an <mark style='background:#f7b731'>action potential</mark>.

An action potential is roughly 100 mV fluctuation in the electrical potential across the cell membrane that lasts for about 1 ms.

During the <mark style='background:#20bf6b'>refractory period</mark>, the neuron cannot respike or generate a new action potential (this is like a cooldown for the neuron).
