**Neurons** → <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">specialized for generating electrical signals in response to chemical and other inputs, and transmitting them to other cells.</mark>

**Dendrites** → <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Receive inputs from other neurons and the axon that carries the neuronal output to other cells.</mark> (This information is transferred from neuron-to-neuron in synaptic connections)

**Axons** → <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">From single neurons can traverse large fractions of the brain or, in some cases, of the entire body.</mark>
