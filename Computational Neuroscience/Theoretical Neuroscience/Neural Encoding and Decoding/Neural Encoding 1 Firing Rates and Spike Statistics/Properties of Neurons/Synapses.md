Axons terminate at <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>synapses</mark> where the voltage transient of the action potential opens ion channels, producing and influx of $Ca^{2+}$ that leads to the release of a neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter binds to receptors at the signal-receiving or postsynaptic side of the synapse, causing ion-conducting channels to open. Depending on the nature of the ion flow, the synapses can have either an:
* Excitatory
* Depolarizing
* Inhibitory
* Typically hyperpolarizing
effect on the postsynaptic neuron.
