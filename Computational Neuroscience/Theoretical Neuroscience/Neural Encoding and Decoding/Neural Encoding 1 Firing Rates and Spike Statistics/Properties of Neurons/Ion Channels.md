Neurons have physiological specializations. Most prominent among these are a wide variety of membrane-spanning **_ion channels_** that allow ions such as:
* Sodium $Na^+$
* Potassium $K^+$
* Calcium $Ca^{2+}$
* Chloride $Cl^-$
to move **into and out of the cell**.

Ion channels control the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">flow of ions across the cell membrane by opening and closing in response to voltage changes and to both internal and external signals.</mark>
