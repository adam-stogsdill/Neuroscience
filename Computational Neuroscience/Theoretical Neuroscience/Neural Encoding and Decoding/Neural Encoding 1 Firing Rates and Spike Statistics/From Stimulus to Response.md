Characterizing the relationship between stimulus and response is difficult because neuronal responses are complex and variable. Neurons typically respond by producing complex spike sequences that reflect both the <mark style='background:#8854d0'>intrinsic dynamics of the neuron</mark> and the <mark style='background:#8854d0'>temporal characteristics of the stimulus</mark>.

Isolating features of the response that encodes changes in the stimulus can be difficult especially if the time scale for these changes is of the same order as the average interval between spikes.

There are various sources for variability in response to the same stimulus:
	* Variable levels of arousal and attention
	* Randomness associated with various biophysical processes that affect neuronal firing
	* The effects of other cognitive processes taking place during a trial

Typically, many neurons respond to a given stimulus, and stimulus features are therefore encoded by the activities of large neural populations. In studying population coding, we must examine <mark style='background:#2d98da'>not only the firing patterns of individual neurons</mark> but also the <mark style='background:#3867d6'>relationships of these firing patterns to each other across the population of responding cells</mark>.

<mark style='background:#8854d0'>In this chapter, we introduce the firing rate and spike-train correlation functions, which are basic measures of spiking probability and statistics.</mark> We also look at spike-triggered averaging (a method for relating action potentials to the stimulus that evoked them.) Finally, we present basic stochastic descriptions of spike generation, the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson models, and discuss a simple model of neural responses to which they lead.
