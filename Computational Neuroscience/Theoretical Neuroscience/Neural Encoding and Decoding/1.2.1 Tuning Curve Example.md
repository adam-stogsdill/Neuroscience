The above figure (A) shows extracellular recordings of a neuron in the **primary visual cortex (V1)** of a monkey. While these were being made, a bar of light was moved at different angles across the region of the visual field where the cell responded to light. This region is called the receptive field of the neuron. Note that the number of APs fired depends on the angle of orientation of the bar. The same effect is shown in the figure (B) in the form of a **response tuning curve**. 

The data has been fitted by a **response tuning curve** of the form $$f(s) = r_{max}exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{s-s_{max}}{\sigma_f})^2)$$
where 
* $s$ is the orientation angle of the light bar
* $s_{max}$ is the (preferred) orientation angle evoking the maximum average response rate ($s-s_{max}$ taken to lie in the range between -90 and +90 degrees)
* $r_{max}$ is the maximum average response rate
