The above figure (A) shows extracellular recordings of a neuron in the **primary visual cortex (V1)** of a monkey. While these were being made, a bar of light was moved at different angles across the region of the visual field where the cell responded to light. This region is called the receptive field of the neuron. Note that the number of APs fired depends on the angle of orientation of the bar. The same effect is shown in the figure (B) in the form of a **response tuning curve**. 

The data has been fitted by a **response tuning curve** of the form $$f(s) = r_{max}exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{s-s_{max}}{\sigma_f})^2)$$
where 
* $s$ is the orientation angle of the light bar
* $s_{max}$ is the (preferred) orientation angle evoking the maximum average response rate ($s-s_{max}$ taken to lie in the range between -90 and +90 degrees)
* $r_{max}$ is the maximum average response rate

$s_{max}$ is considered the "preferred" orientation because that is when the stimulus creates the highest response in the neuron.

Response tuning curves can be used to **characterize the selectivities of neurons** in visual and other sensory areas to a variety of stimulus parameters.

Tuning curves can also be measured for neurons in motor areas, in which case the average firing rate is expressed as a function of one or more parameters describing a motor action.

The above figure (A) shows an example of extracellular recordings from a neuron in **primary motor cortex** in a monkey that has been trained to reach in different directions.

The stacked traces for each direction are rasters showing the results of five different trials. The **horizontal axis** in these traces represents time, and each mark indicates an action potential. The firing pattern of the cell, in particular the rate at which spikes are generated, is **correlated with the direction of arm movement**, and thus encodes information about this aspect of the motor action.

The data points have been fitted by a **tuning curve** of the form: $$f(s)=[r_0+(r_{max}-r_0)cos(s-s_{max})]_+$$
* $s$ is the reaching angle of the arm
* $s_{max}$ is the reaching angle associated with the maximum response $r_{max}$
* $r_0$ is an offset or background firing rate that shifts the tuning curve up from the zero axis.
* The minimum firing rate is $2r_0-r_{max}$. For the neuron of (B), this is a positive quantity, but for some M1 neurons $2r_0-r_{max} < 0$, and the function above is negative over some range of angle. Because firing rates cannot be negative, the cosine tuning curve must be [[Equations#^0e3ed1|half way rectified]] in these cases.

The above figure (B) shows how the average firing rate of V1 neuron depends on retinal disparity and illustrates another important type of tuning curve.

<mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>Retinal disparity</mark> â†’ a difference in the retinal location of an image between the two eyes (Above Figure A) In the image, the data points have been fitted with a tuning curve called a logistic or **sigmoidal** function, $$f(s)=\frac{r_{max}}{1+exp((s_{1/2}-s)/\Delta_s)}$$
* $s$ is the retinal disparity 
* $s_{1/2}$ is teh disparity that produces a firing rate half as big as the maximum value $r_{max}$
* $\Delta_s$ controls how quickly the firing rate increases as a function of $s$. If $\Delta_s$ is negative, the firing rate is a monotonically decreasing function of $s$ rather than a monotonically increasing function such as figure 1.7B.
