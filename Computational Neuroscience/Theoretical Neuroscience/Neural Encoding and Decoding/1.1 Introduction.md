If a neuron is depolarized sufficiently to raise the membrane potential above a threshold level, a positive feedback process is initiated, and the neuron generates an <mark style='background:#f7b731'>action potential</mark>.

An action potential is roughly 100 mV fluctuation in the electrical potential across the cell membrane that lasts for about 1 ms.

During the <mark style='background:#20bf6b'>refractory period</mark>, the neuron cannot respike or generate a new action potential (this is like a cooldown for the neuron).

# Properties of neurons
**Neurons** → <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">specialized for generating electrical signals in response to chemical and other inputs, and transmitting them to other cells.</mark>

**Dendrites** → <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Receive inputs from other neurons and the axon that carries the neuronal output to other cells.</mark> (This information is transferred from neuron-to-neuron in synaptic connections)

**Axons** → <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">From single neurons can traverse large fractions of the brain or, in some cases, of the entire body.</mark>

Neurons have physiological specializations. Most prominent among these are a wide variety of membrane-spanning **_ion channels_** that allow ions such as:
* Sodium $Na^+$
* Potassium $K^+$
* Calcium $Ca^{2+}$
* Chloride $Cl^-$
to move **into and out of the cell**.

Ion channels control the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">flow of ions across the cell membrane by opening and closing in response to voltage changes and to both internal and external signals.</mark>

Under resting conditions, the potential inside the cell membrane of a neuron is about -70 mV relative to that of the surrounding bath, and the cell is said to be <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">polarized</mark>. Ion pumps located in the cell membrane maintain concentration gradients that support this <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">membrane potential</mark> difference. (Ions flow into and out of the cell due to both voltage and concentration gradients)

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Hyperpolarization</mark> → Current in the form of positively charged ions flowing out of the cell (or negatively charged ions flowing into the cell) through open channels makes the membrane potential more negative.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Depolarization</mark> → Current flowing into the cell changes the membrane potential to less negative or even positive values. 

Axons terminate at <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>synapses</mark> where the voltage transient of the action potential opens ion channels, producing and influx of $Ca^{2+}$ that leads to the release of a neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter binds to receptors at the signal-receiving or postsynaptic side of the synapse, causing ion-conducting channels to open. Depending on the nature of the ion flow, the synapses can have either an:
* Excitatory
* Depolarizing
* Inhibitory
* Typically hyperpolarizing
effect on the postsynaptic neuron.

# Recording Neural Responses
![[Pasted image 20230228211505.png|600]]
The referenced image illustrates intracellular and extracellular methods for recording neuronal responses electrically (they can also be recorded optically).

Membrane potentials are measured intracellularly by connecting a hollow glass electrode filled with a conducting electrolyte to a neuron, and comparing the potential it records with that of a reference electrode place in the extracellular medium.

Intracellular recordings are made either with:
* <mark style='background:#0fb9b1'>sharp electrodes</mark> → inserted through the membrane into the cell
* <mark style='background:#f7b731'>patch electrodes</mark> → have broader tips and are sealed tightly to the surface of the membrane.

The **top trace** in the referenced figure is a schematic of an intracellular recording from the soma of a neuron firing a sequence of action potentials. The recording shows rapid spikes riding on top of a more slowly varying subthreshold potential.

The **bottom trace** is a schematic of an intracellular recording made some distance out on the axon of the neuron. These recording are usually very difficult and rare, thus these images are drawings.

The **middle trace** illustrates an idealized, noise-free extracellular recording. Here an **electrode** is placed near a neuron but it does not penetrate the cell membrane. Such recordings **CAN** reveal the APs fired by a neuron, but **NOT** its subthreshold membrane potentials.

# From Stimulus to Response

Characterizing the relationship between stimulus and response is difficult because neuronal responses are complex and variable. Neurons typically respond by producing complex spike sequences that reflect both the <mark style='background:#8854d0'>intrinsic dynamics of the neuron</mark> and the <mark style='background:#8854d0'>temporal characteristics of the stimulus</mark>.

Isolating features of the response that encodes changes in the stimulus can be difficult especially if the time scale for these changes is of the same order as the average interval between spikes.

There are various sources for variability in response to the same stimulus:
	* Variable levels of arousal and attention
	* Randomness associated with various biophysical processes that affect neuronal firing
	* The effects of other cognitive processes taking place during a trial

Typically, many neurons respond to a given stimulus, and stimulus features are therefore encoded by the activities of large neural populations. In studying population coding, we must examine <mark style='background:#2d98da'>not only the firing patterns of individual neurons</mark> but also the <mark style='background:#3867d6'>relationships of these firing patterns to each other across the population of responding cells</mark>.

<mark style='background:#8854d0'>In this chapter, we introduce the firing rate and spike-train correlation functions, which are basic measures of spiking probability and statistics.</mark> We also look at spike-triggered averaging (a method for relating action potentials to the stimulus that evoked them.) Finally, we present basic stochastic descriptions of spike generation, the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson models, and discuss a simple model of neural responses to which they lead.
