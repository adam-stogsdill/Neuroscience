Action potentials convey information through their timing! Although action potentials can vary somewhat in <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>duration</mark>, <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>amplitude</mark>, and <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>shape</mark>, they are typically treated as identical stereotyped events in neural encoding studies.

An AP sequence can be characterized simply by a list of the times when spikes occurred. For _n_ spikes, we denote these types by $t_i$ with $i=1,2,...,n$. The trial during which the spikes are recorded is taken to start at time 0 and end at time $T$, so $0 ≤ t_i ≤ T$ for all $i$. The spike sequence can also be represented as a sum of infinitesimally narrow, idealized spikes in the form of Dirac $\delta$ functions. $$\rho(t)=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\delta(t-t_i)$$
We call $\rho(t)$ the neural response function and use it to re-express sums over spikes as integrals over time. For example, for any well behaved function $h(t)$, we can write 
$$\sum^{n}_{i=1}h(t-t_i)=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}h(\tau)\rho(t-\tau)d\tau$$
where the integral is over the duration of the trial. The equality follows from the basic defining equation for a $\delta$ function, 
$$\int\delta(t-\tau)h(t)d\tau = h(t)$$
provided that the limits of the integral surround the point $t$ (if they do not, the integral is 0) ^f8a157

Due to variability in APs they are typically treated statistically or probabilistically. For example, they may be characterized by firing rates, rather than as specific spike sequences. <mark style='background:#f7b731'>The term "firing rate" is applied conventionally to a number of different quantities</mark>. The simplest of these is called <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>spike-count rate</mark>, which is obtained by counting the number of APs that appear during a trial and dividing by the duration of the trial. We denote the <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>spike-count by r</mark>, where 
$$r = \frac{n}{T} = \frac{1}{T}\int^{T}_{0}\rho(\tau)d\tau$$
The second equality follows from the fact that $\int\rho(\tau)d\tau = n$ and indicates that the spike count rate is the <mark style='background:#3867d6'>time average of the neural response function over the duration of the trial</mark>.

The spike-count rate **can** be <mark style='background:#f7b731'>determined from a single trial</mark>, but at the <mark style='background:#20bf6b'>expense of losing all temporal resolution about variations in the neural response during the course of the trial</mark>. To get a time-dependent firing rate, it can be defined by **counting spikes over short time intervals**, but this can't be computed from a single trial.

>[!note] Time-Dependent Firing Rate Example
>We can define the firing rate at time $t$ during a trial by counting all the spikes that occurred between times $t$ and $t + \Delta t$, for some small interval $\Delta t$, and diving this count by $\Delta t$. However, for small $\Delta t$, which allows for high temporal resolution, the result of the spike count on any given trial is about to be either 0 or 1, giving only two possible firing-rate values. Thus the solution is to average over multiple trials. Thus, we define the time-dependent firing rate as the average number of spikes (averaged over trials) appearing during a short interval between times $t$ and $t + \Delta t$, divided by the duration of the interval.

### Lets Calculate The Time Dependent Firing Rate

To make a time-dependent firing rate we are going to take the samples between some time $t$ and $t + \Delta t$. (Note: this requires multiple sample to accomplish)

The average number of spikes during this interval is the integral of the **trial-averaged** neural response function. To notate this we use the angled brackets $<>$, to denote *averages over trials that use the same stimulus*. For example, $<z>$, for any quantity z is the sum of the values of z from many trials involving the same stimulus, divided by the number of trials. The trial-averaged neural response function is denoted by $<\rho(t)>$, and the time-dependent firing rate is given by 
$$r(t) = \frac{1}{\Delta t}\int^{t+\Delta t}_{t} <\rho(\tau)>d\tau$$
To understand with code here is something I whipped up:
```python
for t in range(0, self.data_array.shape[-1], delta_t):
	data.append(np.sum(np.sum(self.data_array[:, t:t+delta_t], axis=0)) / delta_t)
```

The <mark style='background:#2d98da'>average number</mark> of spikes over a longer time interval is given by the integral of r(t) over that interval.

If $\Delta t$ is too small, there will never be more than one spike in the interval $[t, t + \Delta t]$ and so $r(t)*100$ becomes the percentage of trials with a spike within this interval. Equivalently, $r(t)$ is the probability that a spike occurs during this time.

In any integral expression such as $\sum^{n}_{i=1}h(t-t_i)=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}h(\tau)\rho(t-\tau)d\tau$, the neural response function generates a contribution whenever a spike occurs. If we use the trial-average response function instead, as in equation $r(t) = \frac{1}{\Delta t}\int^{t+\Delta t}_{t} <\rho(\tau)>d\tau$, this generates contributions proportional to the fraction of trials on which a spike occurred.

Because of the relationship between the fraction and the firing rate, we can replace the trial-averaged neural response function with the firing rate $r(t)$ within any well-behaved integral, for example, $$\int h(\tau)<\rho (t - \tau)>d\tau = \int h(\tau) r(t - \tau)d\tau$$
for any function $h$. This establishes an important relationship between the average neural response function and the firing rate; the two are equivalent when used inside integrals. It also provides another interpretation of $r(t)$ as the trial-averaged density of spikes along the time axis.

This all yields the following equivalency which we refer to as the **average firing rate**.$$<r> = \frac{<n>}{T} = \frac{1}{T}\int^{T}_{0}<\rho (\tau)>d\tau = \frac{1}{T}\int^{T}_{0}r(t)dt$$
The first equality indicates that $<r>$ is just the <mark style='background:#f7b731'>average number of spikes per trial divided by the trial duration</mark>.

The third equality follows from the <mark style='background:#8854d0'>equivalence of the firing rate and the trial-averaged neural response function within intervals</mark>.

The average firing rate is equal to both the time average of $r(t)$ and the trial average of the spike-count rate $r$. Of course, a spike-count rate and average firing rate can be defined by counting spikes over any time period, not necessarily the entire duration.

The term "firing rate" is commonly used for all quantities, $r(t)$, $r$, and $<r>$. Whenever possible, we use the terms:
* "Firing rate" → $r(t)$
* "Spike-count rate" → $r$
* "Average firing rate" → $<r>$

# Measuring Firing Rates
The firing rate $r(t)$ **CANNOT** be determined exactly from the limited data available from a finite number of trials. **IN ADDITION**, there is no unique way to approximate $r(t)$. There are a few ways of accomplishing this and are shown in the image below (we will go into further detail in this section as well)
![[Pasted image 20230302183250.png|500]]
The above figure shows 3s of the response of a neuron in the inferotemporal cortex recorded while a monkey watched a video. Neurons in the region of cortex where this recording was made are selective for complex visual images, including faces. A simple way of extracting an estimate of the firing rate from a spike train like this is to **divide time into discrete bins of duration $\Delta t$, count the number of spikes within each bin, and divide by $\Delta t$.  

#### Lets Perform the Sliding Window Computation (C in the above figure)
Counting spikes with preassigned bins produces a firing-rate estimate that depends on the size of the time bins and the placement of said bins. To avoid this issue, we can take a single bin or window of duration $\Delta t$ and slide it along the spike train, counting the number of spikes within the window at each location.

In the figure above (C), the curve is shown with a sliding window of 100 ms wide window along the spike train. The firing rate approximated in this way can be expressed as the sum of a window function over the times $t_i$ for $i = 1,2,…,n$ when the $n$ spikes in a particular sequence occurred, $$r_{approx}(t) = \sum^{n}_{i=1}w(t-t_i)$$
where the window function is $$w(t) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      \frac{1}{\Delta t} & -\Delta t / 2 \leq t < \Delta t/2 \\
      0 & otherwise \\
\end{array} 
\right. $$
Remember that the rates obtained at times separated by less than one bin width are correlated because they involved some of the same spikes.

This can be written as the integral of the window function times the neural response function: $$r_{approx}(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}w(\tau)\rho(t-\tau)d\tau$$
This integral is called a **linear filter**, and the window function $w$, also called the filter **kernel**, specifies how the neural response function evaluated at time $t-\tau$ contributes to the firing rate approximated at time $t$.

#### Calculating Figure Smoother Function (D)
The jagged appearance of the curve in the figure is caused by the discontinuous shape of the window function used. An approximate firing rate can be computed using virtually any window function $w(\tau)$ that goes to 0 outside a region near $\tau = 0$, provided that its time integral is equal to 1. For example, instead of the rectangular window function used in the above figure C, $w(\tau)$ can be a Gaussian:$$w(\tau)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_w}exp(-\frac{\tau^2}{2\sigma_w^2})$$ In this case, $\sigma_w$ controls the temporal resolution of the resulting rate, playing a role analogous to $\Delta t$. A continuous window function like the Gaussian used in equation 1.8 generates a firing-rate estimate that is a smooth function of time. (Note: this rate tends to peak later than the rate computed in (D) using a temporally symmetric window function)

# Tuning Curves

Neuronal responses typically depend on many different properties of a stimulus. We characterize responses of neurons as **functions** of just one of the **stimulus** attributes to which they may be sensitive. (The stimulus is denoted by , $s$)

#### Simple Characterization
A simple way of doing this is to **count the number of action potentials fired during the presentation of a stimulus**. (Most appropriate if the parameter $s$ characterizing the stimulus is held constant over the trial.) If we average the number of APs fired over (in theory, an infinite number of) trials and divide by the trial duration, we obtain the average firing rate, $<r>$ defined [[Equations#^518f0a|here]].

The average firing rate, $<r>$, written as a function $s$, $<r> = f(s)$, is called the **response tuning curve**. The functional form of a tuning curve depends on the parameter $s$ used to describe the stimulus. The precise choice of parameters used as arguments of tuning curve functions is partially a matter of convention. Because tuning curves correspond to firing rates, they are measured in units of spikes per second or Hz.

I separated the rest of the chapter into [[1.2.1 Tuning Curve Example]] because it felt like it was too specific for a use case but I wanted it to be available to me and the user.
