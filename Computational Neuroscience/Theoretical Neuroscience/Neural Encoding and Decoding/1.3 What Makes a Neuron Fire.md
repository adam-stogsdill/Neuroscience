<mark style='background:#20bf6b'>Response tuning curves characterize the average response of a neuron to a given stimulus.</mark>

Now we look at **averaging the stimuli that produce a given response**. To do this, we need to specify what fixed respone we will use to "trigger" the average. Otherwise an **Action Potential!**

Because of this we ask, "What, on average, did the stimulus do before an action potential was fired?"

The resulting quantity, called the <mark style='background:#fa8231'>spike-triggered average stimulus</mark>, provides a useful way of characterizing neuronal selectivity.

Spike-triggered averages are computed using stimuli characterized by a parameter $s(t)$ that varies over time. But first, we must **describe some features of such stimuli**.

### Describing the stimulus
Neurons responding to sensory stimuli need to encode parameters that can vary over an enormous dynamic range!

For example, photoreceptors in the retina can respond to single photons or can operate in bright light with an influx of millions of photons per second. To deal with such wide-ranging stimuli, sensory neurons often respond most strongly to rapid changes in stimulus properties and are relatively insensitive to steady-state levels.

<mark style='background:#3867d6'>Steady-state responses</mark> â†’ highly compressed functions of stimulus intensity, typically with lograithmic or weak power-law dependences. 

This compression led to a few interesting ideas.
#### Weber's law
Weber measured how different the intensity of two stimuli had to be for them to be **reliably discriminated**. He found that, for a given stimulus $\Delta s$ is proportional to the magnitude of the stimulus. 

#### Fechner's law
Fechner suggested that noticeable differences set the scale for perceived stimulus intensities. Meaning, the perceived intensity of a stimulus of absolute intensity $s$ varies as $log(s)$.

There are numerous adaptations made to adjust to the average level of stimulus intensity. When a stimulus generates that adaptation, the relationship between stimulus and response is often studied in a potentially simpler regime by describing reponses to fluctuations about a mean stimulus.

This means that $s(t)$ is defined so that its time average over the duration of a trial is 0, $\int^{T}_{0}\frac{s(t)}{T}dt = 0$. This condition is often used.

There are two different types of averages in neural encoding analysis:
1) averages over repeated trials that employ the same stimulus, notation uses angle brackets.
2) averages over different stimuli, avoid notation using time-dependent stimuli. **Thus, stimulus averages are replaced by time averages**. (Stimuli are squished into a single sequence)

For cases when there is stimuli that occur at different times, we can use integrals to model the time-translationally invariance so that for any function, $h$, and time interval $\tau$, $$\int^{T}_{0}h(s(t+\tau))dt = \int^{T+\tau}_{\tau}h(s(t))dt+\int^{T}_{0}h(s(t))dt$$
TO assure the last equality, we define the stimulus outside the time limits of the trial by the relation $s(T+\tau)=s(\tau)$ for any $\tau$, thereby making the stimulus **periodic**.

### The Spike-Triggered Average
The <mark style='background:#0fb9b1'>spike-triggered average stimulus</mark>,$C(\tau)$, is the average value of the stimulus a time interval $\tau$ before a spike is fired.

For a spike at time $t_i$, we determine $s(t_i-\tau)$, and then we sum over all $n$ spikes in a trial, and divide the total by $n$. In addition we average over trials. Thus, $$C(\tau)=\langle\frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}s(t_i-\tau)\rangle \approx \frac{1}{\langle n \rangle}\langle\sum^{n}_{i=1}s(t_i-\tau)\rangle$$
(approx equal because if $n$ is large, the total number of spikes on each trial is well approximated by the average number of spikes per trial, $n\approx\langle n \rangle$.

This image describes the process we just showed. Normally $\tau$ could have "unlimited" range, in practice this is shorten to a reasonable interval. This process can also be expressed as an integral. $$C(\tau) = \frac{1}{\langle n \rangle}\int^{T}_{0}\langle\rho(t)\rangle s(t-\tau)dt = \frac{1}{\langle n \rangle}\int^{T}_{0}r(t) s(t-\tau)dt$$

<mark style='background:#0fb9b1'>Correlations functions</mark> are a useful way of determining how two quantities that vary over time are related to one another. Those two quantities being related are evaluated at **different times**, one at time $t$ and one at another time $t + \tau$. 

The correlation function is obtained by **averaging their product over all $t$ values, and it is a function of $\tau$.

The ***correlation function of the firing rate*** and the stimulus is: $$Q_{rs}(\tau)=\frac{1}{T}\int^{T}_{0}r(t)s(t+\tau)dt$$
Knowing what we know from before: $$C(\tau)=\frac{1}{\langle r \rangle}Q_{rs}(-\tau)$$
where $\langle r \rangle = \langle n \rangle / T$ is the average firing rate over the set of trials.

THe spike-triggered average stimulus is often called the <mark style='background:#f7b731'>reverse correlation function</mark> because of the $-\tau$. This correlation can be seen below.

The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">spike-triggered stimulus</mark> is widely used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">study and characterize neural response</mark>. $C(\tau)$ is the average value of the stimulus at time $\tau$ before a spike, larger values of $\tau$ represent times farther away from the spike value. This is why we plot spike-triggered averages with the time axis going backwards (as seen in the image above). **This means that we can read off from the plots in the usual left-to-right order.**
