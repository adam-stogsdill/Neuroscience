<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Descriptive models</mark> summarize large amounts of experimental data compactly yet accurately, thereby characterizing what neurons and neural circuits do.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Mechanistic models</mark> address the question of how nervous systems operate on the basis of known anatomy, physiology, and circuitry.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Interpretive models</mark> use computational and information-theoretic principles to explore the behavioral and cognitive significance of various aspects of nervous system function, addressing the question of why nervous systems operate as they do.
