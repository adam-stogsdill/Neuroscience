Optical imaging is a promising future technology that involved either the changes in absorption or scattering of light by neurons due to their electrical activity, or the use of reporter (typically fluorescent) dyes that respond to changes in the concentration of certain ions (like calcium) entering the neuron during activity.

Changes in scattering or absorption of infrared light have been used to a lesser extend in humans where optical access to tissue has existed,
such as retina or cortex during surgery. 

More recently, neuroscience has exploded with optogenetics, which uses genetic modification to produce neurons that change fluorescence when theyâ€™re active or can be activated or inhibited when illuminated.
