The brain computes! What is meant here is that any brain takes the incoming sensory data, encodes them into various biophysical variables, such as the membrane potential or neuronal firing rates, and subsequently performs a very large number of ill-specified operations, frequently termed computations, on these variables to extract relevant features from the input.

This book is dedicated to understanding in detail the biophysical mechanisms responsible for these computations. Its scope is the type of information processing underlying perception and motor control, occurring at the millisecond to fraction of a second time scale.

Before we proceed, let us briefly pause and consider what we mean by computation. Any physical process that transforms variables can be thought of as a _computation_ as long as it can be <mark style='background:#fa8231'>mapped onto one or more mathematical operations that perform some useful function</mark>.

There are several levels that we can observe:
* <mark style='background:#8854d0'>The Computational level of description</mark> → involves a description of the mathematical function that systems performs.
* <mark style='background:#2d98da'>Biophysical level of description</mark> → necessary to characterize the bandwidth, variability, and temporal resolution of the associated variables.

We must ask ourselves to what extend the biophysics of membranes, ionic channels, and synapses dictate the types of operations implemented in the nervous system. In order to understand the style of computation practiced by nervous systems, we must study their hardware.
