Any biophysical system instantiating an information processing system that needs to survive in the real world must obey several constraints:
	1) It must operate at high speeds
	2) It must have a rich repertoire of computational primitives, with the ability to implement a variety of linear and nonlinear, high-gain, operations
	3) It must interface with the physical world - in the sense of being able to represent sensory input patterns accurately and translate the result of the computations into action, that is motor output.

The membrane potential is the one physical variable within the nervous system that fulfills these three requirements:
1) It can vary rapidly over large distances
2) The membrane potential controls a vast number of nonlinear gates - ionic channels - that provide a very rich substrate for implementing nonlinear operations.
3) These channels transduce visual, tactile, auditory, and olfactory stimuli into changes of the membrane potential, and such voltage changes back into the release of neurotransmitters of the contraction of muscles.
