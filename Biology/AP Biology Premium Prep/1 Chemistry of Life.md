### Elements
All living things are made of matter that is **exchanged with the environment to grow, reproduce, and maintain organization**.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Matter -(Made up of)→ Elements</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Elements</mark> → are substances that **cannot** be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means.

### The Essential Elements of Life
96% of the mass of all living things are made of four elements:
1) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Oxygen</mark> (O)
2) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Carbon</mark> (C)
3) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Hydrogen</mark> (H)
4) <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Nitrogen</mark> (N)

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Used to build carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, also storage compounds and cells in all organisms.</mark>

Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, and Magnesium are present but in smaller quantities to the first four elements.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Trace Elements</mark> → required by an organism in very small quantities (Iron, Iodine, Copper)

### Subatomic Particles
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Atoms</mark> → the smallest unit of an element that retains its characteristic properties.

Atoms are made up of **subatomic particles**:
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Protons</mark> (Positive)
* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Neutrons</mark> (Neutral)
* <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Electrons</mark> (Negative)

![[subatomic_particles.png|600]]

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Nucleus</mark> → core of the atom, where protons and neutrons are stored.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Isotopes</mark> → Atoms that have the same number of protons but differ in the number of electrons.

### Compounds
(Chemical) <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Compound</mark> → Two or more individual elements are combined in a fixed ratio.

**Chemical Reaction**:
$$2H_2 (g)+O_2(g) \rightarrow 2H_2O (l) $$
The atoms of a compound are held together by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">chemical bonds</mark>, which may be:
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Ionic bonds</mark> → Formed between two atoms when one or more electrons are **transferred** from one atom to the other. (First, one atom loses electrons and becomes more positive, other atom gains electrons and becomes negative. These atoms are called **ions**)
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Covalent bonds</mark> → Electrons are **shared**. If the electrons are shared equally  between the atoms, the bond is called **nonpolar covalent**. If the electrons are shared unequally, the bond is called **polar covalent**. Single, double, and triple covalent bonds correspond to the number of electrons shared.
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Hydrogen bonds</mark> 

### Water: The Versatile Molecule
In water molecules, the electrons are not shared equally in the bonds between hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen atoms have a partial positive charge and the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge. Meaning that this molecule is **polar**.

The types of intermolecular attractions between water molecules are called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hydrogen bonds</mark>.  Although weak, in large quantities these bonds can be strong. They create properties such as:
* Cohesion
* Adhesion
* Surface Tension
* High Heat Capacity
* Expansion on Freezing

### Cohesion and Adhesion
Water molecules have a strong tendency to stick together, exhibiting **cohesive forces**.

Water molecules also like to stick to other substances - that is they're **adhesive**.

The two forces taken together allow water to perform **capillary action**.

## Surface Tension
The cohesion of water molecules contributes to its surface tension. The water molecules are stuck together and light thinks like leaves and water striders can sit atop the surface without sinking.

### Acids and Bases

**REACTIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY WHETHER THE SOLUTION IN WHICH THEY OCCUR IS** <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">ACIDIC</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BASIC</mark>, OR <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NEUTRAL</mark>.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">What makes a substance acidic?</mark> → It contains a lot of hydrogen ions ($H^+$). They will release a lot of hydrogen atoms when dissolved into water.

What makes a substance basic? → It contains very little hydrogen ions and instead releases _hydroxide ions_ ($OH^-$). These solutions are said to be **alkaline** a.k.a basic.

The acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be measured with a **pH scale**. The pH scale is numbered from 1 to 14. The midpoint, 7, is considered a **neutral** pH. (Example: If a solution contains a lot hydrogen ions, then it will be acidic and have a low pH)

Calculation for acidity:
$$pH = -log[H^+]$$

Thus 1 pH means there are $10^{-1}$ Moles of Hydrogen ions **(MORE ACIDIC)**. While 14 pH means that there are $10^{-14}$ Moles of hydrogen ions **(MORE BASIC)**.

### Organic Molecules
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Organic Compounds</mark> → Chemical compounds in living things that contain a skeleton of carbon atoms

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Inorganic Compounds</mark> → Molecules that do not contain carbon atoms.

Most macromolecules are chains of building blocks, called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">polymers</mark>. The individual building blocks of polymers are called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">monomers</mark>.

Monomers → Polymers → Macromolecules

### Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolysis Reactions

**Breakdown of words:**
* Dehydration → removal of water
* Synthesis → creation
* hydro → water
* lysis → breakdown

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Dehydration synthesis</mark> is a common reaction for <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">joining things</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">hydrolysis</mark> is a common reaction for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">separating things</mark>.

Polymers are formed through **dehydration synthesis** (or **condensation**) reactions. In these reactions, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a water molecule is lost, and a larger compound is formed</mark>.
![[dehydration.png|900]]

Polymers can be also broken down into monomers. That's called **hydrolysis** which means the water breaks the bond between the two monomers.
![[hydrolysis.png|900]]

>[!note] To Recap:
>* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Organic compounds</mark> contain <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">carbon atoms</mark> **AND** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hydrogen atoms</mark> (and sometimes other things too).
>* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Inorganic compounds</mark> **DON'T** contain both carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms
>* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Polymers</mark> are formed through **dehydration synthesis reactions and broken down through hydrolysis reactions**.

NOW LETS FOCUS ON THE FOUR CLASSES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS CENTRAL TO LIFE ON EARTH:
1) Carbohydrates
2) Proteins
3) Lipids
4) Nucleic Acids

### Carbohydrates
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Carbohydrates</mark> → organic compounds that contain **carbon**, **hydrogen**, and **oxygen**. They usually contain these three elements in a ratio of approximately <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1:2:1</mark>, respectively.

We can represent the portion of elements within carbohydrate molecules by the formula $C_nH_{2n}O_n$, which can be simplified as $(CH_2O)_n$.

Most carbohydrates are categorized as either **monosaccharides**, **disaccharides**, or **polysaccharides**. The term <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">saccharides</mark> is a fancy word for "sugar"!The prefixes (mono-, di-, and poly-) refer to the number of sugars in the molecule.

#### Monosaccharides: The Simplest Sugars
Monosaccharides, the simplest sugars, serve as an **energy source for cells**. The two most common sugars are:
1) <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Glucose</mark>
2) <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Fructose</mark>
(Galactose, ribose, and deoxyribose are also monosaccharides)

Both glucose and fructose are six-carbon sugars with the chemical formula $C_6H_{12}O_6$. Glucose, the most abundant monosaccharide, is the most popular sugar around. Glucose is an important part of the food we eat, and it is the favorite food made by plants during **photosynthesis**.

Fructose, the other monosaccharide is a common sugar in fruits.

Glucose and fructose can be depicted as either "straight" or "rings".

Here are the two different forms:

![[glucose_fructose.png]]

#### Disaccharides
What happens when two monosaccharides are brought together? The Hydrogen from one sugar molecule combines with the hydroxyl group (-OH) of another sugar molecule.
![[dehydration.png|800]]
When two monosaccharides are joined, the bond is called a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">glycosidic linkage</mark> and the resulting sugar is called a disaccharide. (The disaccharide formed by two glucose is maltose) Other common disaccharides include sucrose and lactose.

To separate the sugars, just add water.
![[hydrolysis.png|800]]

#### Polysaccharides
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Polysaccharides are made up of many repeated units of monosaccharides. </mark>(Polysaccharides can consist of branched or unbranched chains of monosaccharides.) The most common polysaccharides are, **starch**, **cellulose**, and **glycogen**.

**Glycogen** and **starch** → sugar storage molecules. Glycogen stores sugar in animals and starch stores sugar in plants.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Cellulose</mark>, on the other hand, is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">made up of β-glucose and is a major part of the cell walls in plants</mark>. Its function is to lend structural support. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Chitin</mark>, a polymer of β-glucose molecules, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">serves as a structural molecule in the walls of fungus and in the exoskeletons of arthropods</mark>. 

### Proteins
**Proteins perform most of the work in your cells, and are important for structure, function, and regulation of your tissues and organs**.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Amino acid</mark> → are organic molecules that serve as the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">building blocks of proteins</mark>. They contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms. There are 20 different amino acids.

Every amino acid has four important parts around a central carbon:
1) an **amino group** ($-NH_2$)
2) a **carboxyl group** ($-COOH$)
3) a hydrogen
4) and an **R-group**

Here's a typical amino acid.
![[plain_aminoacid.jpg|800]]

Amino acids differ only in the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">R-group</mark>, which is also called the **side chain**. The R-group associated with an amino acid could be as simple as a hydrogen atom (as in the amino acid _glycine_) or as complex as a charged carbon skeleton (as in the amino acid _arginine_).
![[glycine_arginine.jpg|800]]

When it comes to spotting an amino acid, simply keep an eye out for the amino group ($NH_2$); then look for the carboxyl molecule ($COOOH$). The side chains for each amino acid vary greatly.

>[!abstract] How do the side chains of the amino acids differ?
>* Composition of elements (C, H, O, N, and S)
>* Polarity (polar, nonpolar)
>* Charge (neutral, positive, negative)
>* Shape (long chain, short chain, ring-shape)

Side chain polarity affects whether an amino acid is more <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">hydrophobic</mark> or more <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hydrophilic</mark>.

While there are different ways of categorizing amino acids, we can separate them into 3 broad categories:
1) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Hydrophobic</mark> (non-polar and uncharged)
2) <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Hydrophilic</mark> (polar and uncharged)
3) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ionic</mark> (polar and charged)

### Polypeptides
When two amino acids join, they form a **dipeptide**. The carboxyl group of one amino acid combined with the amino group of another amino acid.
![[dipeptide.jpg|800]]
>[!note] Building a Chain:
>The new amino acid is always added on the carboxyl end of the existing chain

This is the same dehydration synthesis process we saw earlier. (A water molecule is removed to form a bond.)

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Peptide bond</mark> → the name of the bond between two amino acids.

If a group of amino acids is joined together in a "string," the resulting organic compound is called a **polypeptide**. Once a polypeptide chain twists and fold on itself, it forms a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">three-dimensional structure</mark> called a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">protein</mark>.
![[proteins.jpg|800]]

The specific order of amino acids in a peptide can change the identity of the peptide and determine how the peptide affects the overall shape of a protein. In the dipeptide above, notice the one end of the peptide has an amino group ($NH_2$) while one end has a carboxyl group ($COOH$)

**Generally, all peptides will have an end with an amino group, called N-terminus or amino terminus, in addition to an end with a carboxyl group, called C-terminus or carboxyl terminus.**

### Higher Protein Structure
The polypeptide has to go through several changes before it can officially be called a protein. Proteins can have four levels of structure. The linear sequence of the amino acids is called the **primary structure** of a protein. Now the polypeptide begins to twist, forming either a coil (known as an alpha helix) or zigzagging patter (known as beta-pleated sheets). These are examples of proteins' **secondary structure**.

A <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">polypeptide folds and twists because the different R-groups of the amino acids are interacting with each other</mark>. Depending on which amino acids are in a protein and the order that they are in, the protein can twist and fold in very different ways. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">This is why proteins can form so many different shapes</mark>.

After the secondary structure reshapes the polypeptide, amino acids that were far away in the primary structure arrangement can now also interact with each other. This is called the **tertiary structure**. Because most proteins are found in an aqueous environment, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hydrophilic amino acids and regions of the peptide chain are often located on the exterior of the protein</mark>. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Hydrophobic amino acids and regions are usually found on the interior of proteins</mark>. Tertiary structure often <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">minimizes the free energy of the molecule and locks into a stable 3D shape</mark>.

Lastly, several different polypeptide chains sometimes interact with each other to form a **quaternary structure**. The different polypeptide chains that  come together are often called **subunits** of the whole protein.
![[polypeptide_org.jpg|800]]
A classic example of a protein with quaternary structure is hemoglobin. Each of the four polypeptide chains create a subunit of the final hemoglobin protein.
![[Pasted image 20230201022412.png|700]]

Only proteins that have folded correctly into their specific 3-dimensional structure can perform their function properly. Mistakes in the amino acid chain can create oddly shaped proteins that are nonfunctional

In some cases, the folding of proteins involves other proteins known as **chaperone proteins (chaperonins)**. They help the protein fold properly and make the process more efficient.

### Lipids
Lipids consist of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">carbon</mark>, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">hydrogen</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">oxygen</mark> atoms, but not in the 1:2:1 ratio typical of carbohydrates. The most common examples of lipids are **triglycerides, phosopholipids,** and **steroids**.

Lipids are important because, due to their nonpolar structures, they function as:
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">structural components of cell membranes</mark> 
* sources of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">insulation</mark>
* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">signaling molecules</mark>
* and means of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">energy storage</mark>

#### Triglycerides
Our bodies store fat in tissue called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">adipose</mark>, which is made of cells called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">adipocytes</mark>; these cells are filled with <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">lipids called triglycerides</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Each triglyceride is made of a glycerol molecule (sometimes called the glycerol backbone) with three fatty acid chains attached to it</mark>. 

A fatty acid chain is mostly a long chain of carbons in which carbon is covered in hydrogen. One end of the chain has a carboxyl group (just like we saw in an amino acid).

A fatty acid can be <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">saturated</mark> with hydrogens alongs its long carbon chain or it can have a few gaps where double bonds exist instead of a hydrogen.

If there is a double bond in the chain, then it is an <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">unsaturated</mark> fatty acid. A <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">polyunsaturated</mark> fatty acid has many double bonds within the fatty acid.

#### Lipid Saturation
The extent of saturation in a lipid can affect its structure and function. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Th more double bonds that exit within a lipid that exists within a lipid , the more unsaturated it is</mark>:
![[saturated_unsaturated_FA.jpg|800]]

When molecules are linear, they are more easily able to stack together and interact with each other more tightly; thus saturated fats tend to form solids at room temperature (an example is butter). When molecules are kinked, they **CANNOT** pack as tightly and tend to be liquid at room temperature (an example is an oil).

>[!note] Make the Connection
>Amino acids have carboxyl groups and fatty acids have carboxyl groups. Carboxyl groups are acidic; hence they both have acid in their name.

One exception to this rule is an unsaturated fatty acid with _trans_-double bond as below:
![[trans_cis_unsaturated_FA.jpg|800]]

With this trans-double bond, the unsaturated lipid is relatively linear, as would be expected in a saturated fat. Due to the relative linearity, they are more likely than unsaturated with cis-double bonds to be a solid at room temperature.

### Phospholipids
Another special class of lipids is known as phospholipids. Phospholipids contain two fatty acid "tails" and one negatively charge phosphate "head". Take a look at a typical phospholipid.
![[phospholipid.jpg|800]]
Phospholipids are extremely important, mainly because of some unique properties they posses, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">particularly with regard to water</mark>. 

The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">two fatty acid tails</mark> are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">hydrophobic</mark>. Fatty acids are nonpolar, and nonpolar substances **don't mix well with polar ones**, such as water.

On the other hand, the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">phosphate "head"</mark> of the lipid is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hydrophilic</mark>, meaning that it **does mix well with water**.

Since a there is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">hydrophobic and a hydrophilic region</mark>, it is an <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">amphipathic molecule</mark>.

Thus, the two fatty acid chains orient themselves away from water, while the phosphate portion orients itself toward the water. (Keep this in mind for when we think of phospholipid functions and interactions)

#### Cholesterol
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Cholesterol</mark> → a four-ringed molecule that is found here and there in membranes. It generally **increases** <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">membrane fluidity</mark>, except at very high temperatures when it helps to hold things together instead. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cholesterol is also important for making certain types of hormones and for making vitamin D</mark>. Here are some examples:
![[cholesterol.jpg|800]]

### Nucleic Acid 
The fourth class of organic compounds is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">nucleic acids</mark>. Like proteins, nucleic acids contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, but nucleic acids also contains phosphorus. Nucleic acids are molecules that are made up of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">simple units</mark> called <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nucleotides</mark>. Most important ones are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Deoxyribonucleic acid</mark> (**DNA**) and <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">ribonucleic acid</mark> (**RNA**).
![[DNA_RNA.jpg|800]]

DNA is important because it contains the heredity "blueprints" of all life. RNA is important because it's essential for protein synthesis. We'll discuss DNA and RNA in greater detail when we discuss heredity. The following table summarizes the important macromolecules discussed here.

## Summary
* Compounds are composed of two or more types of elements in a fixed ratio.
* Molecules are held together by ionic bonds and covalent bonds.
* Hydrogen bonding is essential for the following emergent properties of water:
	* Cohesion
	* Adhesion
	* Surface Tension
	* High Heat Capacity
	* Expansion on Freezing
	* Polar Structure
	* Ability to dissolve other polar (hydrophilic) substances but inability to dissolve nonpolar (hydrophobic) substances.
* pH is important for biological reactions. Solutions may be acidic (**more $H^+$ ions and lower pH**), basic/alkaline (**less $H^+$ ions and higher pH**)
* Organic molecules contain carbon atoms. Many molecules in biology are composed of several monomers bound together into polymers. The creation of these polymers occurs through dehydration synthesis reactions. The breakdown of these polymers occurs through hydrolysis reactions.
* Important organic macromolecules in biology include:
	* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Carbohydrates</mark>: monosaccharides link by glyosidic bonds to form di- and polysaccharides. Examples are: glucose, fructose, glycogen, cellulose, and starch.
	* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Proteins</mark>: 20 different amino acids, each with a different R-group, link together via peptide bonds to form polypeptides. The chain further folds up into special shapes to make the final protein structure. The structure can be divided into primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets), tertiary (disulfide bonds), and quaternary (multiple polypeptides).
	* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Lipids</mark>: chains called fatty acids (either saturated or unsaturated) combine on a glycerol backbone to form phospholipids and triglycerides.  Cholesterol is another type of lipid. Lipids are hydrophobic.
	* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Nucleic acids</mark>: chains of either DNA or RNA nucleotides. They carry the genetic recipes in the body.
