## What are we going to do?
* Understand Biological Function

## There are two ways to study biology

### Biochemistry
Understand life by grinding it up and studying individual components. (We need to purify - 1 component away from the rest)

Most likely going to look at proteins.

### Genetics
We are going to study the organism minus the one component. (Looking primarily at mutants.) Called the mutation a gene.

Middle of the 20th century: unification between genes and proteins creating →

### Molecular Biology
Genes are DNA!
DNA is read out to RNA which is then used to create protein.

1970s We learned out to look at genes in a more complex way: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Recombinant DNA</mark>.

Mid 1980s - Mapping genes to disease and now we are studying the genome. Thus creating…

### Genomics
Here we are now studying the genes and the whole! The Human Genome Project. ($3 billion)
