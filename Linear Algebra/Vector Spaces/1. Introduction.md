A *vector* is and entity involving both magnitude and direction. It is represented by an arrow where the length is the magnitude and the direction is the direction of the vector. We regard vectors with the same magnitude and direction as being equal irrespective of their positions.

**Parallelogram Law for Vector Addition.** The sum of two vectors *x* and *y* that act at the same point P is the vector beginning at P that is represented by the diagonal of parallelogram having *x* and *y* as adjacent sides.

In the figure above the vector that points to Q is the summation of vector *x* and *y*. Notice how adding *x* after *y* or *y* after *x* is exactly the same. So we know that the additive property is true for vectors.

Say $x = (a_1, a_2)$ and $y = (b_1, b_2)$, when we calculate $x+y$ we get the resulting vector $Q$ where $Q = (a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2)$. To also prove the additive property we know that $y + x = (b_1+a_1, b_2+a_2)$ and because we know adding scalars will result in a scaler we know that $Q$ both ways is equivalent. ðŸ˜Š

Now we can learn *scaler multiplication*! Where we multiply a vector by a scalar value which effectively multiplies the length/magnitude of the vector by that scaler. If the scalar is a negative value we scale in the opposite direction.

Lets take our original *x* vector where $x = (a_1, a_2)$. In the event where we multiply it by the scalar *t*. When we calculate $tx$ we get the resulting vector $tx = (ta_1, ta_2)$

The algebraic descriptions of vector addition and scalar multiplication for vectors in a plane yield the following properties:

1. For all vectors $x$ and $y$, $x + y = y + x$.
2. For all vectors $x$, $y$, and $z$, $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$
3. There exists a vector denoted by *0* such that $x + 0 = x$ for each vector $x$.
4. For each vector $x$, there is a vector $y$ such that $x+y=0$.
5. For each vector $x$, $1x=x$.
6. For each pair of real numbers $a$ and $b$ and each vector $x$, $(ab)x = a(bx)$
7. For each real number $a$ and each pair of vectors $x$ and $y$, $a(x+y) = ax+ay$.
8. For each pair of real numbers $a$ and $b$ and each vector $x$, $(a+b)x = ax+bx$
These results can be used to write equations of lines and planes in space.

**Example 1**
Let *A* and *B* be points having coordinates (-2, 0, 1) and (4, 5, 3), respectively. The endpoint *C* of the vector emanating from the origin and having the same direction as the vector beginning at *A* and terminating at *B* has coordinates (4, 5, 3) - (-2, 0, 1) = (6, 5, 2). Hence the equation of the line through A and B is $$x = (-2,0,1)+t(6,5,2)$$

Here is an image to help visualize this example. The blue vector is *A*, yellow *B*, and purple the equation *x(t)*. Essentially we find the "slope" of the points by subtracting them and then assigning the tail to a particular point, which in this case is the blue vector.

Now let *A*, *B*, *C* denote any three **noncollinear** points in space. Because they can not be intersected by a line (due to the noncollinearity) must represent a **plane**. To find the equation of the plane we will perform a similar procedure to example 1. 

Let *u* and *v* denote vectors beginning at *A* and ending at *B* and *C*, respectively. Observe that any point in the plaine containing *A*, *B*, and *C* is the endpoint *S* of a vector *x* beginning at *A* and having the form *su + tv* for some real numbers s and t. The endpoint of *su* is the point of intersection of the line through *A* and *B* with the line through *S* parallel to the line through *A* and *C*.

This form of this plane equation is: $$x = A + su + tv$$

were *s*, and *t* are arbitrary real numbers and *x* denotes an arbitrary point in teh plane.

**Example 2**

Let *A*, *B*, and *C* be the points having coordinates (1, 0, 2), (-3, -2, 4), and (1, 8, -5), respecitvely.

First calculate the vector emanating from A to the point B by some coefficient, in this case is *s*: $$(-3,-2,4)-(1,0,2)=(-4,-2,2).$$

Then we calculate the vector emanating from A to the point C multiplied by some scaling coefficient, in this case *t*: $$(1,8,-5)-(1,0,2)=(0,8,-7)$$

Combining these calculated values, we get the following equation:
$$x = (1,0,2)+s(-4,-2,2)+t(0,8,-7).$$

Any mathematical structure possessing the eight properties above is called a *vector space*. We go into more detail here: [[2. Vector Spaces]]
