Major Themes:
* Found Machine Learning as a path for continuing my undergraduate education
* ML did not satisfy the need to explore human cognition
* What do I want to do with this degree?
	* Enhance our understanding of the brain and the mechanisms that govern its function and bridge the neurological and mechanical gaps between Neuroscience and AI
	* Expand into many disciplines such as <mark style='background:#f7b731'>developing more precise mechanisms for learning</mark>, <mark style='background:#2d98da'>developing better systems for diagnosing and understanding mental heath conditions</mark>, further <mark style='background:#fa8231'>researching the brain and developing better tools for doctors to analyze a plethora of nervous system-related afflictions</mark>.
* What I did for research in undergrad, capstone project, and current work.
	* Investigating Confidence-Based Category Transition of Spatial Gestures. Human Psychology and Language
	* Medical Documentation Disambiguation
	* Work with RAIsonance Inc.
* What my goals are with a PhD in Computational Neuroscience.
	* Help develop innovations and have the ability to formulate research experiments and integrate new technologies to benefit the growth of both areas.
