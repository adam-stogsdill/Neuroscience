I'm Adam Stogsdill. I would definitely say that I'm a huge computer science nerd. I've been programming since I was in the 5th grade and have loved it ever since. I went to Colorado School of Mines and got my Computer Science degree with a focus in Robotics and AI. There I did research in non-verbal Human-Robot Interaction. Now I work as a biotechnical AI/ML Engineer at a startup.
