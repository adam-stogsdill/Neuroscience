Lab Description: Theoretical modeling of physically-constrained models of cognition, with attention given to learning and memory.

#### Neural Theory of Cognition
Hypothesis: The Brain uses the same form of representation to represent information as a function of continuous variables and a relatively small set of data independent operators to manipulate those functions. ([[Cognitive computation using neural representations of time and space in the Laplace Domain|Howard & Hasselmo, 2020]])

#### Neural Representations of time and space and other variables


#### Deep Networks Inspired by Theoretical Neuroscience
