(For a list of 7 letters, the length of $f$ is equal to 7.) Each element in $f$ is then fed into a two-layer recurrent network with analytically computed weights.\n\nThe first layer is recurrent and for the i-th element of the input, vector $f$ has the following dynamics: $$\\frac{dF_s^{(i)}(t)}{dt} = -sF_s^{(i)}(t)+f^{(i)}(t)$$\nHere $s$ is an N long vector, where N is the number of neurons in $F_s^{(i)}$. The impulse response of the neurons in the recurrent layer decays exponentially with the rate constants $s$.\n![[Pasted image 20230213031602.png|800]]\n\nThis layer encodes an approximation of the Laplace transform. To obtain a timeline that estimates $f^{(i)}(t'<t)$ we invert the Laplace transform using the Post approximation: $$\\tilde{f}_{\\tilde{\\tau}}^{(i)}(t)=\\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}s^{k+1}\\frac{d^k}{ds^k}F_s^{(i)}(t)$$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\tau}=k/s$ is a vector of logarithmically spaced values.

To achieve this, we followed the approach described in Tiganj, Cruzado, and Howard (2019). $M$ stores the pairwise temporal relationships between all stimuli subject to logarithmic compression.\n\nFor instance, if we had two stimuli A and B presented with spacing $\\Delta$, $M$ will store that temporal relationship. Note that the knowledge that $A$ was presented $\\Delta$ time before $B$ implies that $B$ was presented $\\Delta$ time after $A$. In other words, $M$ stores the average history, but we can use that information to compute the average future. Specifically, multiplying $M$ from the left with $f^i$ will extract the average history of the i-th stimulus (average $\\tilde{f}^i$). \n\nOn the other hand multiplying $M$ from the right with $f^i$ will extract the average future of the i-th stimulus, which we label as $p^i$: $$p_{\\tilde{\\tau}}=M_{\\tilde{\\tau}}f$$\nAnalogous to $\\tilde{f},p$ is as a 2-D matrix indexed by stimulus identity and $\\tilde{\\tau}$. Note also that instead of learning the average history we could have directly learned the average future via the successor representation."},

We ran the model for 5000 trials with each trial consisting of 7 letters. We represented letters as delta pulses space by 100 time steps, followed by a probe composed of two randomly selected letters.\n\nParameters of the memory representation were as follows: k=8, the number of sequentially activated units for each letter was 100, the peak time of the first unit in the sequence was 50, and the peak time of the last unit was 2000.\n\nAfter the probes were presented, the model scanned sequentially (from more recent towards more distant past) the memory representation $\\tilde{f}$ and integrated the activation of units for each probe.\n\nOnce the threshold of 0.005 was reached for one of the probes, the scanning stopped and that probe was given as a response.\n\nThe model was run in a noise-free case and with added noise. In the latter case, the readout from $\\tilde{f}$ for each probe at every step of the scanning process was multiplied by a random amount of noise.

After the sequence was learned, 5000 probe trials were presented, each containing a stop position for the sequence and two randomly selected letters from the sequence were used as probes. \n\nThe probe letters had a lag between 2 and 7.

We compared the results with the behavioral data from Tiganj et al. (2020). All of the results resembled those obtained in the behavioral versions of JOR and JOI. For correct trials, RT depended only on the lag to the more recent (JOR) / imminent (JOI) probe and not on the lag to the less recent/imminent probe as evidenced by the flat lines in Figure 4. This was a direct consequence of the fact that we used a serial self-terminating search type of model for both memory and prediction. Furthermore, for correct trials, the RT grew sublinearly with the lag. This was a result of the log-compression in the model timeline for both past and future. Finally, the accuracy generated by the model resembles the accuracy observed in the behavioral data. For the noise-free cases, the accuracy was 1 by construction."},
