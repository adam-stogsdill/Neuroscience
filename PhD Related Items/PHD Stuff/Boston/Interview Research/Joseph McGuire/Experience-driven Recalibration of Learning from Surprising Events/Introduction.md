Different environments involve different sources of uncertainty, with profound implications for how decision makers should respond to surprising events.

An event in which violates one's perception is interpreted as:
* a meaningless outlier
* a sign of fundamental change
(How you react to these events will be determined by your knowledge and assumptions about the uncertainty of the event in the context)

## Previous Research
They have approached the problem of inference and prediction in dynamic environments by making a distinction between <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">expected uncertainty</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">unexpected uncertainty</mark>.

#### Expected Uncertainty
Relates to noisy event-to-event fluctuations that are compatible with one's current understanding of how events are generated. (Rolling a dice need not drive updates to one's understanding of the outcome-generating mechanism)

#### Unexpected Uncertainty
Relates to events that do not conform to the known unreliability of predictive cues (such as rolling a six-sided die and getting a seven) and signal a need to update one's beliefs about the underlying content.

## Previous Empirical Work
Previous empirical work has shown that people adaptively modulate the rate at which they learn from new observations by balancing 
* context-appropriate estimates of expected uncertainty
* the likelihood of true change in the outcome-generating process
* and other factors.

These different factors have been linked to dissociable patterns of activity in arousal-related brain systems, frontoparietal cortex, and ventral striatum.

Reduced flexibility of adaptive learning has been associated with dimensions of psychopathology including trait anxiety.

Previous work has largely focused on scenarios in which <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">events that signify fundamental change tend to be more extreme and surprising than events that reflect expected uncertainty</mark>. (For example, in spatial prediction paradigms with "change point" structure, the generative statistics that govern target positions occasionally undergo discrete shifts. Targets subsequent to a change point then to be associated with high _prediction error_, referred to the spatial distance between a target's predicted and actual locations) (In environments with change-point structure, an approximately Bayesian theoretical account holds that a larger prediction error should lead to a higher inferred probability that a change point has occurred, resulting in a higher trial-specific learning rate) <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A related theoretical proposal holds that learning is gated by the associability of a stimulus, which scales with surprise.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">However, high magnitude prediction errors â‰  higher learning rates!</mark> In some situations, good decisions require maintaining stable beliefs in the face of salient but non-predictive events, such as when an investor avoids overreacting to a transient market downturn.
