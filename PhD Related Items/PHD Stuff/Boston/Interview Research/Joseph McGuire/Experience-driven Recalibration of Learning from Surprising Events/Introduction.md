Different environments involve different sources of uncertainty, with profound implications for how decision makers should respond to surprising events.

An event in which violates one's perception is interpreted as:
* a meaningless outlier
* a sign of fundamental change
(How you react to these events will be determined by your knowledge and assumptions about the uncertainty of the event in the context)

## Previous Research
They have approached the problem of inference and prediction in dynamic environments by making a distinction between <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">expected uncertainty</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">unexpected uncertainty</mark>.

#### Expected Uncertainty
Relates to noisy event-to-event fluctuations that are compatible with one's current understanding of how events are generated. (Rolling a dice need not drive updates to one's understanding of the outcome-generating mechanism)

#### Unexpected Uncertainty
Relates to events that do not conform to the known unreliability of predictive cues (such as rolling a six-sided die and getting a seven) and signal a need to update one's beliefs about the underlying content.

## Previous Empirical Work
Previous empirical work has shown that people adaptively modulate the rate at which they learn from new observations by balancing 
* context-appropriate estimates of expected uncertainty
* the likelihood of true change in the outcome-generating process
* and other factors.

These different factors have been linked to dissociable patterns of activity in arousal-related brain systems, frontoparietal cortex, and ventral striatum.

Reduced flexibility of adaptive learning has been associated with dimensions of psychopathology including trait anxiety.

Previous work has largely focused on scenarios in which <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">events that signify fundamental change tend to be more extreme and surprising than events that reflect expected uncertainty</mark>. (For example, in spatial prediction paradigms with "change point" structure, the generative statistics that govern target positions occasionally undergo discrete shifts. Targets subsequent to a change point then to be associated with high _prediction error_, referred to the spatial distance between a target's predicted and actual locations) (In environments with change-point structure, an approximately Bayesian theoretical account holds that a larger prediction error should lead to a higher inferred probability that a change point has occurred, resulting in a higher trial-specific learning rate) <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A related theoretical proposal holds that learning is gated by the associability of a stimulus, which scales with surprise.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">However, high magnitude prediction errors â‰  higher learning rates!</mark> In some situations, good decisions require maintaining stable beliefs in the face of salient but non-predictive events, such as when an investor avoids overreacting to a transient market downturn. People can adapt to environments in which the ideal learning rate is **equal or lower** for surprising events relative to more moderate events.

Down regulating learning in response to non-predictive "oddball" event has been suggested to require vigilance and cognitive control, although other evidence suggests that actively updating beliefs requires additional cognitive resources compared with holding them stable.

Given that surprising events can either up regulate or down regulate learning in different contexts, an outstanding question is to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">what degree adaptive learning undergoes spontaneous, experience-driven recalibration to track the current context's higher-order statistics</mark>. Calibration of adaptive learning, a form of meta learning, has been documented in human behavioral paradigms in which experimental participants were explicitly tasked with optimizing and reporting their predictions about upcoming events and received explicit description, training, and/or event-specific cues to ensure they clearly understood the relevant sources of uncertainty.

Similar questions have come about for current theoretical models of adaptive learning. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Recent work has shown that a neural network model could be configured either to increase or decrease learning in response to extreme events, effectively treating such events as meaningful change points in on environment treating such events as meaningful change points in one environment and meaningless oddballs in another.</mark> This was achieved by associating observations with a latent representation of mental context that evolved with different dynamics in the two environments. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">In this paper, they investigated whether people would acquire patterns of adaptive learning solely through experience, and whether such patterns, once established, would be revised in response to a higher-order change in the experienced statistical structure.</mark>

They used an **eye-tracking paradigm**, uses predictive gaze to measure spontaneous belief updating in the absence of overt instructions. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The paradigm capitalized on the idea that prediction is a natural aspect of moment-to-moment cognition.</mark> While making perceptual judgments about briefly presented targets, participants' eye movements tended to anticipate target onsets, which were temporally predictable but spatially uncertain.

This paper contains two experiments:
* Experiment 1: We used a between participant design to contrast environments in which surprise reflected either meaningful change or meaningless outliers.
* Experiment 2: Using a whithin-participant design, we tested people's ability to adjust their behavioral strategy when the environment's structure reversed.
The two experiments were used to investigate the possibility of an asymmetry in the difficulty of the two environments, such that participants would adapt more easily to environments in which surprising outcomes warranted updating or to environments in which surprising outcomes were better ignored.
