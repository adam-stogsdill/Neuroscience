Different environments favor different patterns of adaptive learning. A **surprising event** that in one context would accelerate belief updating might, in another context, be downweighted as a meaningless outlier. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">This paper investigates whether people would spontaneously regulate the influence of surprise on learning in response to event-by-event experiential feedback</mark>.

There are two experiments, where the participants are performing a perceptual judgement task under spatial uncertainty (n=29, n=63) <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">adapted their patterns of predictive gaze</mark> according to the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">informativeness or uninformativeness</mark> of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">surprising events</mark> in their current environment.

Although significant events reflected meaningful change, potentially reflecting a bias towards interpreting surprise as informative and/or difficulty ignoring salient outliers.
