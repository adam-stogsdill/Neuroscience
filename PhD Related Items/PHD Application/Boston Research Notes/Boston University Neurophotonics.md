The mission of the **BU Neurophotonics Center** is to build and support an interdisciplinary community that can develop and broadly deploy impactful photonics technologies in the neurosciences to advance our understanding of how the brain works in health and in disease.

Research Themes
* fNIRS: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy - non-invasive, portable method employing near-infrared light propagating diffusely through the scalp and brain, for functional monitoring and imaging of human brain hemodynamics.
* Miniscopes
	* The Computational Miniature Mesoscope - aims to enlarge the imaging FOC of miniature fluorescence microscopes reaching cortex-wide while still maintaining cellular resolution.
	* Original Miniscope - provides a modular in-vivo optophysiology rig for awake, freely behaving animals.
* Multiphoton Microscopy - nonlinear excitation of fluorescence allows for excellent optical sectioning, enabling high resolution imaging deep into highly scattering tissue. Two photon microscopy is one of the most widely used tools for neuroimaging, letting researchers image dynamics such as neural activity and blood flow deep into the brain.
