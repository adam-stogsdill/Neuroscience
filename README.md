# Neuroscience
A place for me to place code samples and information related to neuroscience.

I will be storing notes in here about content related to whatever I'm studying at the time in hope to have a repository that maintains all I have learned.

Below using Obsidian's Dataview Plugin, you should be able to see the progress I have made in each book by chapter.
