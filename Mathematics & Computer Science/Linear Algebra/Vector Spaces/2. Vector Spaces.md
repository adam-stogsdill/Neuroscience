In this section, we introduce systems that follow the eight properties from before, but first we formally define this type of algebraic structure.

**Definitions.** A **vector space** (or **linear space**) **V** over a field *F* consists of a set on which two operations (called **addition** and **scalar multiplication**, respectively) are defined so that for each pair of elements *x, y,* in *V* there is a unique element $x+y$ in *V*, and for each element *a* in *F* and each element *x* in *V* there is a unique element *ax* in *V*, such that the following conditions hold.

(VS 1) For all *x*, *y* in *V*,  $x+y=y+x$ (commutativity of addition).
(VS 2) For all *x*, *y*, *z*, in *V*, $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$ (associativity of addion).
(VS 3) There exists an element in *V* denoted by 0 such taht $x + 0 = x$ for each *x* in *V*.
(VS 4) For each element *x* in *V* there exists an element *y* in *V* such that $x + y = 0$.
(VS 5) For each element *x* in *V*, $1x = x$.
(VS 6) For each pair of elements *a*, *b* in *F* and each element *x* in *V*, $(ab)x = a(bx)$.
(VS 7) For each element *a* in *F* and each pair of elemnts *x*, *y* in *V*, $a(x+y)=ax + ay$.
(VS 8) For each pair of elements *a*, *b* in *F* and each element *x* in *V*, $(a + b)x = ax + bx$.

The elements $x + y$ and $ax$ are called the **sum** of *x* and *y* and the **product** of *a* and *x*, respectively.

The elements of the field *F* => **Scalers**
Elements of the vector space *V* => **Vectors**

**Every vector space is regarded as a vector space over a given field, which is denoted by F**.

An object with the form $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$, where the entries are elemnets of a field *F*, is called an **n-tuple** with entries from *F*. The elements are called teh **entries** or **componennts** of the n-tuple. We note, two n-tuples are equivalent if all corresponding entries if $a_i = b_i$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.
