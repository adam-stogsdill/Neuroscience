* DNA Fingerprinting (Using DNA to identify people)

History:
* We can look at genetic makeup of people around the world and traceback human ancestry. (About 4% of your genome is Neanderthal)

Genetic Engineering:
* Create Transgenic Animals and Plants (Adding genes to animals and plants so that we can study the effects of these genes or modify them to help them survive)
* Possible to take genes (that are create proteins that are sensitive to light), send to nerve cells, and to fire nerves using light.
* Editing the genome, changing one singular letter. (modeling or curing a disease)
