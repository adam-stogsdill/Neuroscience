A non-probabilistic deep learning model is a model whos output is the class name or index and is a discrete value. Opposite from [[Non-Probabilistic Deep Learning Model]], these models return a scalar value.

For example, if I have a model that is used to identify the digits (0-9) from images in the MNIST dataset, the output of this model is the class or value that the model believes is related to the input data.
