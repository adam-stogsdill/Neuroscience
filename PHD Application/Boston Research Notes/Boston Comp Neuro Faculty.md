		Brain function changes dynamically from moment to moment, yet current tools cannot precisely resolve how human activity changes rapidly over time. Our research develops computational and signal processing approaches for imaging large-scale brain networks, and applies them to study sleep, arousal, attention, and neurological and psychiatric disorders.
			1) Fast and multimodal brain imaging - A key limitation in studying brain dynamics is the low spatiotemporal resolution of current noninvasive imaging methods. To overcome this barrier, we develop computational models and multimodal imaging approaches that can enable new inferences about neural activity.
			2) Sleep, Attention, and affective states - We apply these techniques to study the dynamic brain states that underlie sleep, attention affective states, and neuromodulation. We study the control circuits that regulate brain states, and the network dynamics underlying sleep and impaired cognition after sleep deprivation.

		Their lab studies the structure and function of the neural circuits distributed across the brain that controls movement. His research leverages cutting edge optical, electrophysiological, and genetic tools for recording and manipulating neural activity during behavior and for illuminating the structure of neural circuits.

		The basis of all cognitive function is communication between neurons in the brain. This communication is mediated by synaptic connections that are modified by experience to encode function. In order to get at the big question of "how the brain works", I study how experience driven synaptic plasticity changes local neocortical physiology. I am particularly interested in how neural circuits are able to incorporate past experience to predictively represent spatiotemporal information. Employing a variety of experimental and computational approaches, my lab examines how the cortical response to specific sensory stimuli change as a consequence of learning. We use the primary sensory cortices, particularly the visual cortex, as relatively accessible and interpretable regions in which to isolate the core biology responsible for coding higher-order information in less accessible neocortical areas. The goal is to elucidate the mechanistic bases of cortical processing algorithms and memory storage.

		Laboratory for Learned Neural Dynamics and Cortical Prediction: The brain is constantly learning. It does this by changing the synaptic connections between neurons based on the activity patters of the neurons themselves, and the implication is that neural representation of "information" (an idea, a memory, how your brain responds when you point your eyes at a tree, etc.) is subtly different every time you think about it. The Gavornik Lab is trying to understand the principles that govern how activity leads to synaptic changes.

		The Ling Lab: Sensation is easy -even a camera can sense light. For a camera, light simply falls onto film, creating a photograph of what was seen; the story ends there. For humans, however, the moment light falls on our retina is but the beginning of an exceedingly complex process, culminating in our rich perceptual experiences. It's this remarkable process that sets our visual system far apart from simple devices such as cameras: our brain's ability to perceive and consciously experience the visual world. our lab's work centers on the pivotal stage of cognitive processing -the stage at which sensation becomes perception. We combine a variety of techniques, including psychophysics, computational modeling, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) -all aimed towards understanding how the brain mediates between the "buzzing confusion" of the visual world and our limited processing power.

		Cognition & Decision Lab: We study the cognitive and neural processes that facilitate human decision making. We are especially interested in how decision markers navigate challenging situations that involve delay, uncertainty, or volatility, or that seem to demand self-control. Our methodological toolbox includes behavioral experiments, computational modeling, psychophysiology, and functional neuroimaging.

		Communication Neuroscience Research Laboratory: Communication neuroscience is the study of how the brain and nervous system control the sending, receiving, and understanding of messages. In humans, most messages are sent using spoken language and are received by listening to other speakers. As such, understanding the brain bases of speech perception and production are at the core of our lab's research. In addition to the content of our speech, when we speak our voices convey a wealth of information about who we are, where we're from, and how we feel. We pay attention to all these cues about other people when we interact with them. We can even share ideas across vast time and distance through reading and writing. Our research approaches these questions about human communication from two avenues. First, we conduct insightful behavioral experiments to discover the factors that enhance, limit, or differentiate our communicative capacities. Second, we utilize sensitive, state-of-the-art technologies for human brain imaging (including structural and functional MRI, EEG, and neuromodulatory techniques) to understand the dynamic neural systems that support communicative behaviors. Our approach is grounded in a systems neuroscience framework -- we want to understand whether complex commucative behaviors like speech and language can be understood as extensions of general-purpose processes for perception and learning.
